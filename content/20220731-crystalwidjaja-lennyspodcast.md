## Scrap Your Way to Growth: Lessons from Southeast Asia's Startup Queen

Crystal Widjaja, former growth lead at Gojek (now GoTo, the largest super app in Southeast Asia) and current Chief Product Officer at Kumu, knows a thing or two about driving user growth. In a fascinating conversation, she reveals how the startup scene in Southeast Asia differs from the US, what growth investments usually pay off (and which ones often don't), and offers a unique approach to building growth teams. 

### The Crazy, Scrappy World of Asian Startups

Forget fancy strategies and sleek tech. Crystal shares how Gojek, facing a unique traffic nightmare in Indonesia, embraced scrappy tactics to scale rapidly. Think: renting a stadium to hire 60,000 drivers in just a few weeks. 

This “do things that don’t scale” mentality fueled their early success. Need to test a subscription feature? Forget building it – just create a WhatsApp group of drivers, explain the pitch, and manually process the subscriptions in the backend. 

Crystal emphasizes this point:

> "This concept of doing things that are somewhat crazy but validate a point, doing stuff that doesn’t scale, especially, I think is really the bread and butter of what we did at Gojek."

**Key takeaways:**

* Don't be afraid to get scrappy in the early days.
* Focus on validating key hypotheses quickly, even with a small user base.
* Manual processes can be your friend when building and testing new features.

### The Super App Conundrum: Why Hasn't the US Caught On?

Crystal sheds light on the cultural and technological differences that have led to the rise of super apps in Asia, like Gojek and Kumu, while the US remains dominated by single-purpose apps.

* **Conglomerate trust:** Asian consumers are more comfortable with conglomerates owning multiple facets of their lives, creating a sense of trust that fuels super app adoption.
* **The mobile-first leapfrog:** Asia skipped the desktop computer era, making mobile phones the primary (and often only) digital device for many. Limited phone storage drives a need for multi-purpose apps.

This unique environment means super apps don't need to be the best at everything, just good enough at a lot of things. 

### Data-Driven Growth: Beyond Vanity Metrics

Crystal debunks the myth of prioritizing retention as a growth goal. Instead, she advocates for a more specific approach:

* **Focus on the step before conversion:** Analyze user behavior leading up to conversion. Often, ineffective copy or user experience hiccups are the culprits behind low conversion rates.
* **Identify pain points in the user journey:** Pay attention to the longest, most painful user paths. Shortening those cycles can significantly impact user behavior and conversion.
* **Don't neglect real-world channels:** Gojek’s physical presence (drivers on the streets) acted as powerful marketing, showcasing the real-world value of their product.

**Remember:** Data should drive action, not just provide entertainment. If your analytics efforts aren't leading to concrete changes, it’s time to re-evaluate your approach. 

### Building a Winning Growth Team: Stats Over Flash

Crystal argues that the ideal early-stage growth hire isn’t a tech wizard but a data-savvy individual with a strong understanding of statistics. 

**Here's why:** 

* A data-driven mindset is crucial for identifying the right growth opportunities and validating hypotheses.
* An understanding of statistical concepts like sampling and selection bias ensures accurate data analysis and informed decision-making.

**Key hiring tips:**

* **Test for first-principles thinking:** Present case studies and ask candidates to explain how they would validate the findings.
* **Assess experimental design skills:** Look for a methodical approach to problem-solving and a willingness to test hypotheses rigorously.
* **Prioritize scrappy execution:** Favor candidates who can move fast and leverage existing resources over those who rely on expensive tools and lengthy integrations.

Don't overestimate the importance of past experience. A young, hungry candidate with a solid grasp of statistics can often outperform a seasoned professional who lacks the analytical rigor required for early-stage growth.

**The most important takeaway from Crystal's insights? "The only thing better than no data is data of what your customers are doing."** So ditch the vanity metrics, get scrappy, and focus on understanding your users. That’s how you build a truly impactful growth strategy.
