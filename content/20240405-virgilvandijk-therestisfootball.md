## An Afternoon with Virgil van Dijk: The Rest is Football Podcast 

The Rest is Football podcast welcomes a very special guest this week: Virgil van Dijk, captain of Liverpool and the Netherlands! While Alan Shearer couldn't make it, the guys are more than happy to have Virgil join them for what he believes is his first ever podcast appearance. 

### Giving Back to the Community with McDonald's

Virgil kicks things off by talking about his day, which was spent working with McDonald's to provide free football sessions for kids across the country. He explains that McDonald's is offering free football to at least half a million kids and that he's been a part of this campaign for a while now. 

* Virgil enjoys playing with the kids and seeing their smiles.
* He's even taken his own children to a session before.
* Virgil believes it's a great way to encourage kids to be active and learn valuable life skills.

### The Making of a Footballing Giant

The conversation then shifts to Virgil's own journey in football. 

* He started playing at a young age, around six or seven, in his local team. 
* Virgil was picked up by Willem II, a mid-table team in the Eredivisie, and played ten years in their academy.
* Interestingly, he didn't consider himself a standout player in his younger years. 

He goes on to describe some of the challenges he faced, including:

* A serious illness and complications from appendicitis.
* A late growth spurt that initially hindered his progress.
* A knee problem that arose after his growth spurt.

Despite these obstacles, Virgil persevered, eventually becoming captain of Willem II before making the move to FC Groningen and later, Celtic.

### From Scotland to Anfield: A Transformative Journey

Virgil's time at Celtic proved crucial in his development, allowing him to experience European football and adapt to a more physical, direct style of play. He also shares his experience of the intense Old Firm rivalry, having played in the derby just once when Celtic faced Rangers in a semi-final at Hampden Park. 

The move to Southampton then paved the way for his eventual transfer to Liverpool. 

* He acknowledges that leaving the Netherlands for Scotland was a big change in his life and a major step in his footballing career. 
* Living in Glasgow, Virgil and his wife (who was then his girlfriend) met some amazing people and enjoyed the city's vibrant atmosphere.
* He also reflects on how his time at Southampton prepared him for the demands of the Premier League.

### The Price Tag and the Pressure

When asked about the pressure associated with his record-breaking transfer fee to Liverpool, Virgil confidently states:

> "It's all about showing your qualities first and foremost... When you show your qualities, when you just being yourself and express yourself in what you can do, no one will speak about any price tag."

He explains that he had no influence on the price tag, and his focus was solely on playing his best football and being an important asset to the club.

###  From Doubts to Triumph: A Champion's Resilience

Virgil frankly discusses the difficult period following his serious knee injury. He reveals the doubts and criticisms he faced, and the mental strength he needed to overcome them. He credits his wife for being a huge source of support during this challenging time. 

Virgil also reflects on the physical and mental challenges of playing almost every game in a season following his return from injury, and how he used that experience to grow and ultimately triumph. 

###  The Klopp Era: A Family Affair

Virgil's admiration for Jurgen Klopp is evident throughout the interview. He praises Klopp's charisma, his ability to instill confidence in the team, and his unique energy. He believes that Klopp's success stems from understanding the city, the culture, and the history of Liverpool Football Club.

* Virgil acknowledges Klopp's high standards and demanding nature, but believes it's necessary to succeed at the highest level. 
* He was surprised by Klopp's decision to leave at the end of the season, but respects his reasons and recognizes that personal life is bigger than football.

### The Rest is Still to Come

The podcast concludes with Virgil looking ahead to the summer and the upcoming European Championships, where he hopes to lead the Netherlands to glory. When asked to choose between winning the Premier League or the Euros, Virgil responds with a smile, "Both of them!" 

This interview gives a fascinating insight into the mindset of a true champion. It's a story of resilience, dedication, and the power of believing in yourself. Virgil van Dijk's journey is far from over, and it's clear that the best is yet to come.
