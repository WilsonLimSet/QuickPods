## The Joy of Steph: An Inside Look at Basketball Brilliance

This episode of The Old Man and The Three podcast is a special one. JJ Redick sits down with none other than Steph Curry, executive producer of the documentary "Holy Moly" and one of basketball's all-time greats. What follows is a revealing conversation touching on everything from Curry's early days to his thoughts on legacy and the intense pressure of being a superstar.

### Early Days and Irrational Confidence

Redick dives into Curry's journey, starting with his college days at Davidson. Curry reveals he was a late bloomer, a "scrawny skinny kid" who didn't initially see himself as a high-volume scorer. It was at Davidson, playing alongside talented point guard Jason Richards, that his shooting prowess truly emerged.

This leads to a discussion of Curry's legendary "irrational confidence", a term he credits to Andre Iguodala. Curry admits to developing a habit of checking Twitter after bad shooting halves during that era, making a game out of the often harsh commentary. He recounts a hilarious anecdote where a beat writer challenged him to celebrate a made shot with an airplane celebration – a challenge Curry readily accepted.

**Key takeaways**:

* Curry was a late bloomer whose scoring potential was unleashed at Davidson.
* He developed "irrational confidence" and learned to embrace the attention, even the negative, early in his career.

### Navigating Superstardom and the Power of Narrative

The conversation shifts to the challenges of navigating superstardom and the power of narratives. Curry reflects on the "chaos" of the Warriors' five-year Finals run, the intense scrutiny, and the pressure to live up to expectations. He emphasizes the importance of staying true to oneself amidst the noise.

Redick inquires about the infamous 2015 Finals MVP going to Andre Iguodala, a decision that sparked controversy. Curry acknowledges feeling he deserved the award but highlights how Iguodala's impact was crucial to their victory. He reflects on the power of narratives and how they can distract from the ultimate goal of winning.

**Key takeaways**:

* Curry learned to navigate the pressures of superstardom by staying true to himself and focusing on the ultimate goal.
* He acknowledges the power of narratives and how they can overshadow individual contributions.

### The "Look Away" Shot and Achieving Flow State

The discussion turns to Curry's signature "look away" shot, a move that embodies his ability to achieve a flow state on the court.  Redick praises Curry's unparalleled ability to consistently reach this state, a testament to his dedication to training and the obsessive attention to detail he brings to his craft.

Curry recounts the first time he performed the "look away" in a game, a moment fueled by the electric atmosphere of Oracle Arena during a playoff series against Denver. He describes the feeling of the shot leaving his hand as "better than that" and how he instinctively knew it was going in.

**Key takeaways**:

* The "look away" shot represents Curry's ability to reach a flow state, honed through meticulous practice and an obsession with detail.
* Curry thrives in high-pressure environments, drawing energy from the crowd and the intensity of the moment.

### The Culture of the Warriors

Redick shifts gears to discuss the culture of the Warriors, a topic often debated in NBA circles. He emphasizes the importance of having the superstar drive the culture, a key factor in the Warriors' sustained success. He credits Curry's leadership style, not through fiery speeches, but through consistently demonstrating his work ethic and belief in his teammates.

Curry echoes this sentiment, highlighting the importance of communicating his need for every player in the locker room to perform their role and contribute to their collective success. He cites examples of "glue guys" who bought into the Warriors' culture and thrived in their roles.

**Key takeaways**:

* Curry's leadership style, characterized by quiet confidence and unwavering belief in his teammates, is a cornerstone of the Warriors' culture.
* The team's emphasis on individual ownership and collective success has fostered a resilient and adaptable environment.

### Beyond the Buzz: The Pure Joy of Basketball

The conversation wraps up with a return to the essence of the game: the pure joy of playing. Redick expresses his amusement at NBA players' exuberance for making even the most audacious shots.  Curry agrees, emphasizing the importance of never losing that childlike love for the game, even amidst the pressures and distractions of a long NBA career.

This leads to a final reflection on legacies and the constant pressure to be ranked among the all-time greats. Curry admits to occasionally thinking about his place in history but emphasizes his focus on enjoying the present moment and continually pushing his own boundaries.

**Key takeaways**:

* Curry's love for the game remains a driving force throughout his career, allowing him to embrace the joy of playing even in high-pressure situations.
* He remains focused on maximizing his own potential and pushing his own boundaries, rather than obsessing over legacy or rankings.

**Ending Quote:**

>  "I still get lost in the game. And when you have a ball in your hands, it’s just a different energy that I have and I want to keep that for as long as I can." - Steph Curry
