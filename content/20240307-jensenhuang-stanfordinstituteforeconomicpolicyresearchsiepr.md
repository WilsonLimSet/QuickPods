## The American Dream, Accelerated Computing, and the Future of AI: A Conversation with Jensen Huang

The Ceeper Economic Summit welcomed Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, in a conversation led by former Ceeper director, John Shoven. The air crackled with anticipation as Huang, a living embodiment of the American Dream, took the stage to discuss the future of technology. 

### Jensen Huang: A Silicon Valley Success Story

Shoven kicked things off by highlighting Huang's remarkable journey â€“ from arriving in the US at age nine to co-founding Nvidia at 30. This Silicon Valley titan built a company that now stands as the fourth largest in the world, a testament to his hard work, dedication, and innovative spirit.

* Born in Taiwan, arrived in the US at age nine
* Navigated a tough school in Kentucky
* Skipped two grades, graduated from high school early
* Earned an electrical engineering degree from Oregon State
* Received a Master's degree from Stanford
* Co-founded Nvidia at 30

Huang's story truly embodies the spirit of equal opportunity for success through dedication and initiative, the very essence of the American Dream.

### Accelerated Computing: The Key to Unlocking AI's Potential

Huang emphasized the pivotal role of **accelerated computing** in driving the AI revolution. He explained how Nvidia, over the past three decades, has been dedicated to this new form of computing, driving down the marginal cost of computation to near zero. This has enabled the emergence of software written by computers themselves, powered by vast amounts of data.

Huang eloquently described this paradigm shift: 

> "So what happens when you are able to take the marginal cost of something to approximately zero? We enabled a new way of doing software where it used to be written by humans, we now can use computers to write the software."

### AI: Understanding the Meaning of Everything

By driving down computational costs, Nvidia has made it possible to extract and analyze all digital human knowledge from the internet, creating large language models (LLMs) capable of understanding the meaning behind vast datasets. 

Huang pointed out that this technology is not limited to text and code. LLMs can also be applied to understanding the meaning of biological data like gene sequences, amino acids, and proteins. This opens up incredible possibilities for drug discovery and disease understanding.

### The Future of AI: Continuous Learning and Grounded Intelligence

Looking ahead, Huang envisions a future of **continuous learning** where AI systems are constantly evolving, grounding themselves in both real-world data and synthetically generated data. This will enable AI to develop a deeper understanding of the world, reasoning and planning in ways previously unimaginable.

He also stressed the importance of ensuring AI is grounded not just in factual knowledge, but also in human values, ensuring that this powerful technology aligns with our ethical principles. 

### Competition, Collaboration, and a Future for Everyone

Huang acknowledged the competitive landscape in the AI chip market, highlighting that Nvidia faces competition not only from other companies, but also from its own customers building their own solutions.  He emphasized, however, that Nvidia's advantage lies in its comprehensive platform and its focus on driving down the total cost of operations for data centers. 

Huang concluded his talk with an inspiring message about the democratizing power of AI, closing the technology divide and empowering everyone to become a "programmer" by interacting with computers in human language. 

> "Today, about 10 million people are gainfully employed because they know how to program computers ... That's not true in the future. We all can program computers ... That's the great contribution the computer science industry has made to the world. We've closed the technology divide."
