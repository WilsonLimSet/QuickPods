## From Oracle Comfort to Startup Uncertainty: The Chartmetric Journey

Leaving a cushy corporate job to launch your own startup is never easy. It's a leap of faith, often accompanied by financial uncertainty and a heavy dose of doubt. But for Song Cho, founder and CEO of Chartmetric, the allure of building something truly innovative outweighed the risks. This is his story, a tale of embracing the unknown, celebrating small victories, and finding the courage to chase a long-term vision.

**The Oracle Paradox:**

Song Cho found himself in an interesting predicament while working at Oracle.  He was part of a massive, profitable company, generating billions in cash each month.  This stability felt comforting, offering a sense of security that many entrepreneurs crave.  But something was missing.

* **Lack of innovation:**  Oracle's growth seemed to stem largely from acquisitions rather than internal innovation.  This reliance on external breakthroughs left Song Cho feeling stifled, like he was on the sidelines while the real action was happening elsewhere.
* **Mature market:**  The company's established position in the market made it feel like a "tax collection agency" rather than a dynamic innovator.  This lack of excitement fueled Song Cho's desire to create something new.

**The Startup Plunge:**

Leaving Oracle was a tough decision.  Song Cho had stock options promising significant financial gains if he stayed.  But the entrepreneurial itch couldn't be ignored.  He yearned to build his own company in Silicon Valley, a dream he'd harbored for years. It was "now or never."

* **The first hurdle:**  Song Cho's initial ventures were met with silence.  After months of work, his ideas failed to gain traction. This led to feelings of depression and a sense of being lost. 
* **One step at a time:**  Advice from a trusted friend, who had navigated the startup world successfully, offered a much-needed lifeline.  The simple mantra, "just move forward only one step per day," helped Song Cho overcome the overwhelming pressure to make giant leaps and embrace the slow, steady progress of building a business from scratch.

**Chartmetric's Genesis:**

Chartmetric, a data analytics tool for the music industry, emerged from Song Cho's passion for computer science and his belief in the power of data.  The journey began with small steps, fuelled by a deep commitment to solving a specific problem.

* **The $950 payment:** After launching a paid version of Chartmetric, Song Cho anxiously awaited his first customer.  To his surprise, someone paid for a full year's subscription on the very first day!  This unexpected act of trust, fueled by genuine appreciation for the product's value, was a turning point in Chartmetric's story. It signaled that his vision had resonated, that someone else saw the potential he had believed in all along.
* **The long-term view:**  Building a company takes time.  Song Cho believes in the 10-year rule: nothing truly impactful can be built in less than a decade.  He sees Chartmetric's journey as a gradual evolution from a "vitamin product," nice to have but not essential, to an indispensable tool, a "Bloomberg for the music industry."

**Competitive Edge?**

Song Cho admits that he initially struggled to articulate Chartmetric's competitive advantage.  He doesn't believe in chasing "different" for the sake of being different.  Instead, he focuses on building a product that delivers value, even if it appears similar to existing solutions. 

* **Focus on value:**  Chartmetric's initial pricing strategy - half the cost of competitors - aimed to signal value and encourage early adoption.  The long-term plan is to build a product so robust and data-rich that it becomes indispensable, justifying a higher price point. 
* **Reciprocity in SaaS:**  Song Cho emphasizes the reciprocal relationship between SaaS companies and their early adopters.  By paying for a product that's still evolving, customers contribute to its growth and improvement, ultimately reaping the benefits of a better tool.

**The Journey Continues:**

Seven years in, Chartmetric is approaching $7 million in annual recurring revenue, with clients like Universal Music Group, Sony, Warner, Netflix, Facebook, and Amazon.  But Song Cho's vision extends far beyond these milestones.  He's committed to building a product that becomes the industry standard, a tool so essential that the music business can't imagine operating without it. 

> "I'm running my own agency here in Manhattan. I’m also a business owner. I know how cash is precious in the beginning. So I thought some extra cash could help you, so I decided to give a one-year subscription... anyway, I’m going to use this product for the next 12 months anyway, so paying for an annual subscription is a better deal for me." - **Rene McLain, Chartmetric's first paying customer**
