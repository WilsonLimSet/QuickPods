## Is Your Tech Making You Healthier, Or Just More Anxious?

In today's tech-obsessed world, it seems like every gadget promises to make us healthier. From Apple Watches tracking our heart rates to apps monitoring our sleep, we're constantly bombarded with data about our bodies. But is all this information actually doing us any good?

To find out, we invited Dr. Mike, a board-certified family physician and popular YouTuber, onto the Waveform podcast. As a clinician who sees patients daily, Dr. Mike brings a unique perspective to the conversation, balancing his excitement about the potential of health tech with a healthy dose of skepticism.

### The Problem with Health Tech Today

Dr. Mike's biggest concern is the lack of evidence behind many of the health claims made by tech companies. While they're quick to highlight anecdotal stories of lives saved by their products, they often fail to conduct the rigorous research needed to prove their effectiveness. 

> "No one is actually going that mile to prove that something works 'cause that's really expensive, and a lot of times will backfire 'cause it proves that it doesn't work, and now you've killed your beautiful product." - Dr. Mike

He argues that the healthcare tech industry is operating like a hedge fund, prioritizing profit over proven outcomes. This leads to a proliferation of products that generate a lot of data but offer limited benefits, while potentially increasing health anxiety among users.

### The Apple Watch Dilemma

The Apple Watch is a prime example of this phenomenon. While it boasts impressive fitness and health tracking features, the usefulness of this data is debatable. Dr. Mike acknowledges that the fall detection feature is valuable, but he questions the real-world impact of features like the ECG and heart rate monitor. 

He shared a story of a patient who, despite having the skills to manage his heart condition, became anxious and experienced worse outcomes after receiving frequent high heart rate alerts from his Apple Watch. This highlights the potential for tech to exacerbate health anxiety rather than alleviate it.

### Gamifying Fitness vs. Monitoring Regular Health

Dr. Mike observes a shift in the focus of fitness trackers from promoting active lifestyles to monitoring everyday health. While he acknowledges the potential for gamified fitness to motivate people like Andrew, he emphasizes that most people don't need these tools. 

He argues that the real key to better health is developing sustainable habits, not relying on gadgets to tell you what you already know. "You've evolved as a species for millions of years," he points out. "No one's ever been like, 'I mean, not no one, I should be careful here... 99.999% of individuals know when they're thirsty, and you could just use that as a gauge."

### The Future of AI in Healthcare

While Dr. Mike is skeptical of current consumer-focused health tech, he sees potential for AI to play a more significant role in the future. He believes AI could improve screening methods for conditions like cancer, potentially leading to earlier detection and better outcomes.

However, he cautions against the idea of AI replacing doctors entirely. The human mind, he argues, is uniquely capable of broad, nuanced thinking and connecting with patients on a personal level â€“ qualities that AI has yet to replicate.

### Key Takeaways:

* **Prioritize personal perception:** Understand how you feel and learn about your body before relying on tech-generated data.
* **Focus on sustainable habits:** Don't fall for quick fixes; true health comes from consistent lifestyle changes.
* **Be wary of unproven claims:** Don't trust every health claim made by tech companies. Demand evidence-based solutions.
* **Embrace the potential of AI:** While current health tech may be limited, AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare in the future.

Ultimately, Dr. Mike's message is one of caution and empowerment. He urges us to approach health tech with a critical eye, remembering that **"life has so many variables. There's so many things that can go wrong that are outside of our control... Thinking that you now have the grasp of control by doing one sport or another... It's ridiculous."**
