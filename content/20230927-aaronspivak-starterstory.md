## From Weighted Blankets to $48 Million: The Power of Talking to Your Customers

**This is the story of Aaron Spivak, a young entrepreneur who nearly lost everything launching his business.  He went from beginner's luck to the brink of failure, only to rise again thanks to a simple yet powerful strategy: actually talking to his customers.**

### The Rise and Fall (and Rise Again) of a Weighted Blanket Empire

Aaron Spivak, like many entrepreneurs, had a hustler spirit from a young age. He started businesses selling lemonade, party bus services, and even opened a juice shop in Toronto. But it wasn't until he partnered with Lior, a software developer, that he stumbled upon a truly lucrative idea: weighted blankets.

* They identified a need in the market through simple Google searches.
* Working tirelessly alongside their full-time jobs, they developed a prototype and started running ads. 
* Initial success, fueled by what they thought was entrepreneurial genius, led to rapid growth.

Then, summer hit. And sales plummeted to almost zero.

### Staring Failure in the Face: The Turning Point

Aaron and Lior had made a classic mistake – not forecasting inventory.  They were stuck with hundreds of unsalable blankets and dwindling cash. Lior, ready to call it quits, suggested shutting down the business.

* **"In those moments, it was like looking yourself in the mirror… Am I actually the real deal? Do I… wait, do I actually know what the hell I'm doing?"**  - Aaron Spivak on facing potential failure.

But Aaron wasn't ready to give up. They needed to figure out why their seemingly brilliant idea wasn't working. The answer, as they soon discovered, was surprisingly simple.

### The Power of a Phone Call: Unlocking Customer Insights

In a last-ditch effort, Aaron and Lior emailed their customers, asking for a quick chat. The feedback was eye-opening:

* Customers loved the weighted blanket...but it was too hot for year-round use.

This realization sparked their biggest breakthrough.  Instead of launching a product and hoping for the best, they needed to talk to their customers, understand their pain points, and adapt accordingly.

### From Cooling Blankets to Kickstarter Success

Armed with this newfound wisdom, they spent months developing a cooling weighted blanket, even creating their own unique fabric. Low on funds, they turned to Kickstarter with a modest goal of $25,000. The response was phenomenal:

* They raised over $1 million in the first 30 days. 
* Their "Hush Iced" blanket became a top 10 Canadian Kickstarter of all time.

This success wasn't due to marketing magic, but rather a deep understanding of what their customers truly wanted. 

### A Winning Formula:  Listen, Create, Repeat

Aaron and Lior had stumbled upon a powerful formula:

1. **Talk to customers.**
2. **Understand their problems.**
3. **Create products that solve those problems.**

They replicated this formula with a wildly successful pillow launch (selling 3,000 units in 72 hours!) and expanded into new product lines, including bed sheets and even a mattress. By 2021, they had built a $48 million business.

###  Building a Community, Not Just a Business

Their journey, however, taught them a far more valuable lesson than just product development. By constantly engaging with customers, they inadvertently built a loyal community of "superfans." 

* These customers weren't just buying products; they were invested in Aaron and Lior's story.
* This loyal following is what truly differentiated Hush from its competitors.

**"I think storytelling is the most important thing you can have when you're marketing a brand… and storytelling is the emotions and it's the magic that people want to feel before they go out and purchase something."** - Aaron Spivak on the importance of connecting with your audience.

In a world saturated with brands vying for attention, Aaron and Lior's story is a powerful reminder: Sometimes, the greatest business breakthroughs come from simply picking up the phone and talking to your customers.
