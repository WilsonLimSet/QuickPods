## The Mind of a Visionary: Jensen Huang on Healthcare, AI, and the Power of Belief

This week I had the incredible opportunity to hear Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, speak on the future of healthcare and AI. It was a powerful conversation filled with insights, both technical and philosophical, about the power of innovation and the unique challenges facing the field of biology. 

Here are some of the most interesting takeaways:

### Parallels Between Silicon Chip Design and Biology

Huang drew fascinating parallels between the evolution of the silicon chip industry and the current state of biology. He highlighted the transition from laboratory-based, empirical approaches to "in silico" methodologies in chip design, suggesting that biology is on the cusp of a similar revolution.

* Just as algorithms and computing power transformed chip design, AI and supercomputing have the potential to revolutionize biological research and drug discovery.
* Recursion's focus on developing a "methodology," analogous to the principles outlined in Mead and Conway's seminal book on VLSI design, is key to navigating the complexities of biology. 

### The Unique Contribution of Nvidia in Healthcare

Huang emphasized that Nvidia's strength lies in enabling others, not becoming industry leaders themselves. 

* Nvidia aims to provide the tools and infrastructure (algorithms and computing power) for healthcare innovators like Recursion to leverage their deep domain expertise and make groundbreaking discoveries.
* By partnering with companies like Recursion, Nvidia is fostering a collaborative ecosystem that drives progress in healthcare.

### The Importance of Belief and First Principles

Beyond the technical aspects, Huang stressed the crucial role of belief and reasoning from first principles in driving innovation.

* Founding a company like Nvidia, or undertaking a project like decoding the language of life, requires unwavering belief in the face of widespread skepticism.
* Continuously challenging assumptions and returning to first principles is essential for navigating uncertainty and staying ahead of the curve.

### The Urgency and Opportunity in Healthcare

Huang left no doubt about the urgency and magnitude of the challenge Recursion has embraced, but also the immense opportunity it represents.

* The combination of AI, supercomputing, and Recursion's biological expertise creates a once-in-a-lifetime chance to revolutionize healthcare and impact humanity.
* The urgency stems from the patients waiting for breakthroughs, making every day crucial in the pursuit of solutions.

The conversation ended with a powerful message, one that encapsulates Huang's visionary approach and resonated deeply with me: 

> "You're volunteering to work here. You're volunteering to work. Nothing is stronger than the heart of a volunteer. You're volunteering to work here. And the reason why you volunteer to work here is because you believe in the mission... You get to do it every day! If (what I said is) true, then you get to do it every day. Why wouldn't you want to do it every day? So do it every day. That's the way to think about it." 

This quote perfectly captures the passion, dedication, and sense of purpose that drives true innovators like Jensen Huang and the team at Recursion. It's a reminder that we have the power to choose our work and to make a real difference, every single day.
