## The Startup Mindset at Scale: Insights from a 3x CPO

In this episode of the Lenny's Podcast, Lenny Rachitsky sits down with Claire Vo, a long-time Chief Product Officer at Color, Optimizely, and currently LaunchDarkly. Claire's career path is the stuff of product management dreams, having climbed the ranks from Associate Product Manager to CPO and even founding two companies along the way. This episode is packed with insights on a wide range of topics, but one key theme stood out: **the power of a startup mindset at scale.**

### Scaling Your Career:  Agency, Clarity, and Results

Claire shares invaluable advice for anyone looking to accelerate their career growth, regardless of their role. Here are her key takeaways:

* **Know what you want**: Define your career goals clearly and communicate them to your manager.
* **Focus on solving problems**:  Instead of fixating on promotions, concentrate on how you can help your manager and the company. Think about their pain points and propose solutions that benefit the organization as a whole.
* **Don't be afraid to look sideways**: Explore opportunities outside your immediate scope. Lateral moves can broaden your skillset and create a foundation for future leadership roles.
* **Embrace a "bendable universe"**: Organizations are fluid, especially in growth-stage companies.  Don't limit your thinking to the existing structure; see possibilities to reshape the organization around talented and motivated individuals.

By internalizing these principles, Claire has navigated her career with intention and agency, consistently finding ways to add value and drive positive change.

### Fast Pace, High Bar: Building a Startup Culture in Larger Companies

Many organizations crave the speed and agility of startups but struggle to maintain quality in the process. Claire explains how she fosters a fast-paced environment while upholding a high bar for product excellence:

* **One-Click Faster Clock Speed**:  Claire encourages her team to compress their timelines. If they think something should be done in a year, challenge them to get it done in six months. This mindset shifts the energy and momentum of the organization. 
* **Personal SLAs**:  Claire holds herself accountable for rapid responses and decisions, recognizing that her actions directly impact the pace of the entire organization. She encourages her team to adopt a similar mindset.
* **Normalizing Feedback**:  Claire believes in a culture of open and honest feedback, devoid of judgment. This fosters a high talent bar and ensures expectations are clearly understood.

By applying these principles, Claire ensures her teams move rapidly while never compromising on quality. 

### The Rise of the CPTO: Optimizing for the Whole

Claire advocates for the emerging CPTO (Chief Product and Technology Officer) role, a structure where product, engineering, and design functions report to a single leader. Here's why she believes this model is becoming increasingly relevant:

* **Eliminating Silos**:  The CPTO eliminates debates over what's best for individual functions. Instead, the focus shifts to what's best for the organization as a whole.
* **Singular Accountability**:  This model places clear accountability for R&D investment with a single executive, optimizing resource allocation and driving alignment with business objectives.
* **Harnessing Talent**:  Founders, with their broad experience across functions, are naturally suited to this role, demonstrating that organizational structure should adapt to exceptional talent, not the other way around.

While the CPTO role requires a unique skill set, its ability to streamline decision-making and break down silos makes it an attractive model for many organizations.

### Women in Tech: Curiosity, Empowerment, and Visibility

Claire acknowledges the realities of being a woman in tech, sharing her own experiences with bias and challenges. Despite achieving remarkable success, she still gets asked "if she's technical" despite a background filled with technical accomplishments.  Here's what Claire hopes to see change:

* **Normalization**:  Claire advocates for increased visibility of diverse voices in leadership roles. The industry needs to see more women in tech, particularly in technical leadership positions, to break down ingrained stereotypes.
* **Curiosity and Empowerment**:  Claire emphasizes the importance of approaching challenges with curiosity and a sense of empowerment.  Instead of feeling defeated by systemic issues, she seeks to understand them and find ways to drive positive change.
* **Economic Participation**:  Claire believes that the tech industry is missing out on significant innovation and economic growth by not having more women lead companies and organizations. She encourages women to pursue their passions in tech, despite the existing challenges. 

### The Future of Product Management in the Age of AI

Claire's tool, ChatPRD, has sparked both excitement and anxiety within the PM community.  Here's how she views the evolving landscape:

* **AI as a Tool, Not a Replacement**:  While AI can automate many aspects of the PM role, it will not eliminate the need for human product managers. Instead, the focus will shift from rote tasks to higher-level strategic thinking and influencing.
* **The Importance of Prompt Engineering**:  Creating effective AI tools like ChatPRD requires a deep understanding of the PM function and the ability to craft prompts that generate accurate and actionable outputs.
* **Embracing Change**:  The PM role will undoubtedly evolve rapidly in the age of AI.  Claire encourages product managers to stay curious, embrace new technologies, and specialize in areas where human intelligence and creativity remain paramount.

### Key Quote:

> "People often think that I get hired into later-stage companies because I'm supposed to teach them how to operate like a big company. And in fact, I say I'm hired to remind them they can operate like a startup." - Claire Vo

This episode leaves listeners with a powerful message: **embrace a growth mindset, adapt to evolving technologies, and never underestimate the power of a startup mindset at scale.**
