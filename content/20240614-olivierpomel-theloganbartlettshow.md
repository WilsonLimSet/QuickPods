## Building a $40 Billion Business: Key Insights from DataDog CEO Olivier Pomel

The biggest misconception about an IPO is that it's an exit. It's actually not. It's the starting line, not the finish line."

This quote, from Olivier Pomel, co-founder and CEO of DataDog, perfectly encapsulates the spirit of this conversation with Logan Bartlett. Datadog, a $40 billion business with over $2.5 billion in revenue, is a testament to long-term vision and disciplined execution. Pomel shares fascinating insights into their journey, revealing valuable lessons for any aspiring entrepreneur.

### Early struggles and the Importance of Solving Real Problems

Datadog’s journey began in the challenging fundraising environment of 2010. Pomel candidly recounts the initial difficulties in securing a seed round, which informed two core tenets of their business:

* **Solving Real Problems**: The need to constantly prove their value led to a relentless focus on addressing genuine customer pain points, a principle that remains central to DataDog’s culture.
* **Capital Efficiency**: Fear of running out of funds instilled a deep commitment to building a sustainable and profitable business from day one. This resulted in remarkable capital efficiency, burning only $25 million while generating billions in revenue. 

Pomel's perspective on hardship is particularly insightful. He argues that constraints and difficulties can ultimately be beneficial, forcing companies to focus and innovate. Every struggle overcome strengthens the company and increases its chances of future success. 

### Open Beta and the Power of Self-Selection

DataDog initially adopted a closed beta approach, carefully selecting participants for their platform. However, traction was middling. The turning point came with the decision to open the beta publicly, allowing users to self-select and decide whether the product was worth their time. 

This move proved incredibly successful, generating significant traction and providing invaluable user feedback. Pomel emphasizes that letting users choose, rather than trying to predict the perfect target audience, can be a far more effective strategy, especially for developer-focused products.

### Modularity and Building a Platform for the Future

Pomel outlines DataDog’s vision of creating a modular platform capable of incorporating different data sets, use cases, and personas. While their initial focus was on bringing Dev and Ops teams together, they always aimed for a broader vision, avoiding the restrictive term “monitoring” in favor of a more expansive platform approach.

* **Best-of-Breed Products**: Each product within the platform is designed to be best-of-breed, standing on its own even if separated from the larger ecosystem.
* **Integration and Value**: The real power lies in the integration of these modular products, providing a comprehensive solution that becomes irrational for customers to refuse. 

### Empowering Teams and the Role of Autonomy

To scale effectively, Pomel emphasizes the importance of empowering individual product teams. These teams are kept small and encouraged to engage with customers from day one, fostering a culture of autonomy and rapid iteration.

Pomel’s leadership style underwent a significant transformation, evolving from a self-described control freak to a leader who prioritizes giving space and trust to his team. He believes in viewing his senior management team as peers, allowing them to run their domains independently.

###  Acquisitions: Prioritizing Long-Term Vision and Team Fit

DataDog’s approach to mergers and acquisitions reflects their commitment to building for the long term. Pomel describes a rigorous selection process focused on companies aligned with their vision and passionate about their work:

* **Broad Roadmap**:  Acquisitions are seen as a way to accelerate their already extensive roadmap, not to fill a specific gap.
* **Culture and Motivation**: Companies with a strong cultural fit and a desire to build within the DataDog platform are prioritized over those seeking a purely financial exit.

Post-acquisition, the focus is on rapid integration, setting a 3-6-9 month deadline to ship something tangible, fostering urgency and building confidence among both the acquired team and the existing DataDog organization.

### Data-Informed Decisions and Customer Centricity

While DataDog is a data-driven company, Pomel cautions against solely relying on quantitative data. He emphasizes the importance of qualitative feedback and direct customer interaction:

* **Sampling Data**: He advocates for sampling data from every layer of the organization, gaining a holistic understanding of the “fabric of reality” that goes beyond polished reports.
* **Focusing on Bad News**: He stresses the importance of prioritizing bad news, as it forces the company to confront reality and improve. Good news will come naturally, but bad news requires proactive attention.

###  Key Takeaways: A Recipe for Sustainable Success

Pomel’s insights offer a compelling roadmap for building a sustainable and successful business:

* **Solve real problems, relentlessly.**
* **Embrace capital efficiency from day one.**
* **Empower your teams and foster autonomy.**
* **Prioritize long-term vision in acquisitions.**
* **Stay close to your customers and the “fabric of reality”.**
* **Cultivate a culture of humility, growth, and low drama.**

In conclusion, DataDog’s journey is a testament to the power of staying true to core principles, adapting to changing market dynamics, and building a culture that values long-term success over short-term gains. 

**“Everything you find that is horrible in the world around you started as a genius idea. The intent was not to make everybody miserable.”**
