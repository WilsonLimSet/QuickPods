## The Creative Journey of Jacob Collier: A Masterclass in Embracing the Unknown

In this episode of the podcast, we had the incredible pleasure of sitting down with the one and only Jacob Collier, a six-time Grammy Award-winning musician often referred to as the "Mozart of Gen Z." Our conversation went far beyond the typical "business of being a creator" discussion, diving deep into the heart of creativity itself. Jacob's unique perspective, born from his self-taught journey that began on YouTube, offers a masterclass in embracing the wildness of the creative process.

### The Power of Contribution, not Extraction

Jacob's journey began on YouTube, a platform he saw as a space for "content creators who didn't necessarily want to...conform to...an algorithm."  He contributed his music, driven by the sheer joy of creation and a desire to share something he found "really cool." This spirit of contribution, rather than extraction, is a key takeaway from our conversation. 

* **The Shift in Creative Mentality:** Jacob acknowledges that the creative landscape has shifted in recent years. While the early days of platforms like YouTube were fueled by a desire to contribute and share, today's young creatives often approach creation with a focus on "what can I get from it" rather than "what can I give to it." This awareness of potential success can be paralyzing, preventing young artists from taking those first, crucial steps.
* **The Importance of Staying Open:** Jacob emphasizes the importance of staying open and receptive to new ideas and experiences, even when surrounded by external pressures. He encourages creatives to embrace the journey of discovering their voice, rather than feeling the need to "come in blazingly contributive."

### Finding Your Voice Through Repetition and Comfort

Jacob's comfort on stage and his effortless connection with his audience are the product of years of repetition and a willingness to embrace the unknown.  He highlights the transformative power of comfort, arguing that it's the key to unlocking true creative innovation.

* **From Participation to Contribution:**  Using the example of rehearsing with Joni Mitchell for the Grammys, Jacob illustrates how repetition can lead from simple participation to meaningful contribution. It's in that repeated engagement that we discover "a space for yourself...and then...visualize how that would feel" and ultimately extend ourselves creatively.
* **The Beauty of Imperfection:**  Jacob dispels the myth that creative work must be perfect from the outset. He encourages aspiring artists to "throw paint and see what happens," to "make the worst song in the world" without fear, because it's in that freedom from judgment that the most interesting ideas emerge.

### The Audience as Collaborator: A Symphony of Permission

A fascinating aspect of Jacob's work is the "Audience Choir," a unique element of his live performances where he conducts the entire audience to sing in harmony. This remarkable feat speaks to the power of collective creation and the gift of permission.

* **Beyond Validation, Towards Collaboration:** While acknowledging the significance of validation from respected peers, Jacob places a higher value on collaboration. He views the "Audience Choir" not just as a form of validation, but as a genuine collaborative experience, a space where he and the audience "meet as people who make things...in a place."
* **The Emotional Power of Collective Creation:** The "Audience Choir" is a testament to the emotional power of collective creation. As observers, we feel the chills, the verge of tears, because we witness a "transfer of permission... be wild... be free, but also be a part of this together."

### Navigating a World of Creative Infinity

In the current creative landscape, where the possibilities seem endless and spectacular has become the norm, it can be daunting to find one's footing. Jacob calls this feeling "Creative Infinity Syndrome," a struggle that stems from the "biggest myth... that you have to act now and there's a rush."  He offers a refreshingly grounded perspective on navigating this new world. 

* **The Currency of Time and Attention:** Jacob emphasizes that the true currencies of a creative life are time and attention. With these two things, "you can create any world you want." He rejects the idea that there are "distinct hoops that you need to jump through" to achieve success, advocating instead for a journey of self-discovery and consistent exploration.
* **Building Trust, not Engagement:**  In an age where it's easier than ever to engage an audience, Jacob highlights the importance of building trust. He points out that while it's possible to get "eyeballs on your thing" through trendy content or algorithmic manipulation, the "relationships between you and the core people within your community" are what truly matter.

### The Importance of Asking the Right Questions

As AI becomes increasingly integrated into the creative process, the ability to ask the right questions will be more crucial than ever. Jacob champions a "question culture rather than answer culture," urging creatives to engage with new technology with an open mind and a thirst for exploration.

* **AI as a Collaborator, not a Threat:**  While acknowledging the understandable fear surrounding AI, Jacob encourages a shift in perspective.  He sees AI not as a threat, but as a collaborator, a "supercharged kid who's learning...approaching quantum speeds." He believes that our interaction with AI should be characterized by kindness and guidance, fostering a healthy relationship with this powerful tool.
* **The Enduring Value of Human Expression:** Despite the incredible advancements in technology, Jacob remains unwavering in his belief in the enduring value of human expression. He champions the unique qualities that AI cannot replicate: "the things that keep us up at night... the things that turn us on." Ultimately, he believes that the key to navigating a world increasingly shaped by AI lies in "finding a way to something that feels...good," something that reflects the unique beauty and complexity of the human experience.

**To end with Jacob's own words, the key to success as a creative lies in asking this crucial question:**

> "It's not how many people have I reached, it's of the people that I reached, how many of those did I move?"
