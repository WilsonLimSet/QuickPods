## The Unexpected Journey of Gallant: An Interview with Hard Knock TV

This interview with Hard Knock TV gives us an insightful glimpse into the life and creative process of Gallant, the Grammy-nominated R&B artist. From his quiet beginnings in Maryland to navigating the bustling streets of New York City and finally finding his artistic home in Los Angeles, Gallant's journey is one of self-discovery and unwavering dedication to his craft. 

### A Quiet Kid with a Secret Passion

Gallant paints a vivid picture of his childhood home: the aroma of seafood, the murmur of his parents' conversations, and the ever-present hum of the television. He describes himself as a quiet kid, content in his own world, and it was in this solitude that his passion for music blossomed. 

* **Early influences:** Gallant's musical tastes were unconventional, leaning towards artists like Babyface and Tender Lover rather than the traditional R&B prevalent in his community. He credits this early exploration for his desire to subvert expectations and create something unique.
* **Finding Freedom in Music:** For Gallant, music was an escape, a space where he could express himself without judgment or the pressure to perform. He sought to create sounds that he couldn't find anywhere else, even if it was just for his own ears.

> "I get to be alone and just do my own thing and not worry about what anybody thinks about it."

### Navigating the City That Never Sleeps

Moving to New York City to attend NYU was a natural progression for Gallant, who saw it as a chance to break free from the confines of his suburban upbringing and explore new horizons.  

* **NYU and the Freedom to Experiment:** Gallant chose Gallatin, a school known for its individualized study programs, which allowed him the freedom to pursue his musical interests on his own terms. He reveled in the autonomy, using the university's resources to write and record, much like he had done in his childhood bedroom.
* **The Energy Drain of NYC:** While the city offered opportunities, it also presented challenges.  Gallant, a self-proclaimed introvert, found the constant buzz overwhelming. He relates to the sentiment that New York can drain an introvert's energy, emphasizing the importance of finding space to recharge.

### Finding His Place in the LA R&B Scene

Gallant's move to Los Angeles marked a turning point in his career. The city, despite its own brand of chaos, provided a sense of freedom and space to create that New York lacked.  

* **A Flourishing, yet Overlooked Scene:** Gallant arrived in LA during a time of burgeoning alternative R&B, a movement that was flourishing online but often overlooked by the mainstream. 
* **The Alternative Sound:** He gravitated towards blogs like Liner Notes,  StereoGum, and Hype Machine, immersing himself in the ambient, lo-fi sounds of artists like How to Dress Well. 

### Challenging Genre Expectations

Gallant acknowledges the stereotypical image of the "smooth" R&B artist but chooses to embrace his own unique perspective. He doesn't shy away from expressing the full spectrum of human emotions, including anger, awkwardness, and vulnerability.

* **Beyond the Smooth Operator:** He believes that R&B doesn't have to be limited to tales of love and relationships. By exploring a wider range of human experiences, the genre can become richer and more relatable.
* **The Importance of Self-Expression:** Ultimately, Gallantâ€™s focus is on self-expression. He's driven by the therapeutic act of creating and performing his music, regardless of external opinions.

### The Artist's Job is to Make Art

Throughout the interview, Gallant consistently emphasizes the importance of creating without being burdened by the need for external validation. He shares his appreciation for a quote by Andy Warhol that perfectly encapsulates his philosophy:

> "The job of the artist is to make art. It's like why do you decide whether it's good or bad art? My job is to go make other art."
