## Gojek's Unlikely Rise: From Scrappy Startup to Southeast Asian Super App

In this episode of Lenny's Podcast, we hear from Kevin Aluwi, co-founder and former CEO of Gojek, a company many in the US haven't heard of, despite being on the scale of Uber and Lyft. Kevin shares the incredible story of Gojek's journey from its humble beginnings as a motorcycle taxi service to becoming one of the most successful “super apps” in the world.

### The Scale of Gojek

Gojek’s story is a testament to the power of hustle, innovation, and a deep understanding of local market needs. The company started as a call center connecting customers to motorcycle taxi drivers, a common mode of transportation in Indonesia. Over time, Gojek evolved into a multifaceted super app offering a wide range of services:

- Ride-hailing (motorcycle and car)
- Package delivery
- Food delivery
- Grocery delivery
- Moving services
- On-demand massages and cleaning services
- Movie tickets, loans, payments, and financial services

To illustrate the scale of Gojek’s operations, consider these numbers:

- 2.7 million drivers across Southeast Asia
- 3 billion orders completed last year
- 15 million merchants utilizing the platform

These figures solidify Gojek’s position among the largest companies, not just in Southeast Asia, but globally.

### Rethinking Super Apps: The Importance of a Unifying Concept

Kevin, despite having built one of the world's first super apps, shares a surprising perspective: **super apps are overrated**. While the concept sounds appealing on a strategy deck, the benefits often don't translate into reality.

He points to a key insight learned during Gojek's expansion. When launching a mobile top-up product, a seemingly relevant service for their predominantly prepaid customer base, they discovered that only 40% of their users knew the product existed. This led to the realization that a unifying concept is crucial for users to understand and engage with a super app's diverse offerings.

For Gojek, that unifying factor was the **driver**. Customers understood that the Gojek driver could not only give them a ride, but also deliver packages, food, and groceries.

However, when venturing into services that didn't have this driver association, like massage services, the super app model started breaking down. Users struggled to make the connection, even questioning whether the same driver who picked them up would also be giving them a massage. This highlights the importance of carefully considering user perception and ensuring a logical connection between the various services offered within a super app.

> "It's not as simple as just saying like, ‘Oh, we have a lot of engagement, we have a lot of eyeballs, add a service and you have a super app that makes sense for customers."

### Embracing the Hard Things: Gojek’s Scrappy Spirit

Gojek’s success wasn't solely due to technological prowess; it was deeply rooted in their ability to embrace the "hard things". The company consistently prioritized finding solutions to real-world problems, even if it meant resorting to unconventional and operationally intensive methods.

Two examples perfectly illustrate this scrappy spirit:

- **Building a “cash booth” network:** In the early days, due to the lack of digital payment infrastructure, Gojek had to establish physical cash booths across Indonesia to pay their drivers. This involved setting up spaces with vaults and cash, where drivers would line up to collect their earnings.
- **Combating fraudulent driver apps:** When faced with the challenge of third-party apps stealing driver details and funds, Gojek, lacking the resources to build a robust security system, chose to copy the top features of these fraudulent apps and integrate them into their own platform, effectively neutralizing the threat.

Kevin believes that this willingness to do the hard things, to find innovative solutions even when resources are scarce, is a key differentiator for companies operating outside of established tech hubs like Silicon Valley.

### Brand Building: Beyond Visual Recall

Kevin emphasizes the importance of brand building, not as an afterthought, but as a core element of a company's success. He believes that great brands transcend transactional relationships and become a part of a customer's identity.

He highlights Gojek’s decision to provide drivers with branded jackets and helmets as one of the most crucial steps in building the brand. This wasn’t just about visual recall. By seeing passengers on the back of Gojek motorcycles as they were stuck in traffic, people immediately understood the value proposition and how Gojek could solve their daily transportation woes. This created a powerful association between the brand and a real-world problem.

> " It was like this beautiful combination of, you know, one, just having that imagery and and and having that visual everywhere as a reminder of the brand, but more importantly, it was also a physical kind of reminder of the service of what we do and of how we can help you."

### Lessons Learned and What’s Next

Looking back at his journey with Gojek, Kevin shares key takeaways for founders building companies, especially outside of major tech hubs:

- **Embrace scrappiness:** Be willing to do things that don’t scale, to be operationally intensive in the early stages to solve customer problems and build momentum.
- **Master remote work:** Accessing global talent requires building a strong remote work culture.
- **Don't just copy:** Focus on solving unique problems in your market. Don't be a clone of a Silicon Valley company. Understand your local market dynamics.

As for what’s next for Kevin, he’s currently taking time to explore new interests, engage in angel investing, and share his experiences with other founders.

Gojek’s story is an inspiration for entrepreneurs worldwide, demonstrating that with dedication, ingenuity, and a deep understanding of your market, even the most ambitious goals can be achieved, even if it means embracing the hard way.
