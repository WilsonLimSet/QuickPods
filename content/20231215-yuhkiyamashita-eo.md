## The Power of Storytelling in Product Management: Insights from Figma's CPO

In this fascinating talk, Yuhki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma, delves into the critical role of storytelling in product management. He shares his own career journey, moving from Microsoft to Google, Uber, and ultimately landing at Figma. Throughout this experience, one key lesson stood out: the importance of connecting with users, understanding their needs, and rallying teams around a shared vision. 

**Storytelling: The Heart of Product Management**

Yuhki emphasizes that product managers aren't necessarily the ones directly building the product. Instead, their core strength lies in their ability to motivate everyone involved, from designers to engineers, to focus on the right problems and solutions.

* **Motivation through Narrative:** Effective product managers inspire their teams by crafting compelling narratives that clarify the problem, highlight the potential impact of the solution, and foster a shared understanding of the product's vision.
* **Connecting with Users:** By listening deeply to users and understanding their pain points, product managers can uncover needs that even users themselves may not articulate directly.
* **Building a Shared Vision:** A strong story can align everyone within the company, from engineers to lawyers, around a common goal, fostering a collaborative and efficient product development process.

**A Journey Through Tech Giants: Lessons Learned**

Yuhki's career path offers valuable insights into the power of storytelling in diverse settings:

* **Microsoft:** His initial foray into product management at Microsoft exposed him to the intricacies of the field and allowed him to learn from industry veterans.
* **Google:** Transitioning to Google, Yuhki found himself responsible for a large-scale app - YouTube on iOS. This experience taught him the importance of delegating effectively and empowering teams to make their own decisions based on a shared understanding of the problem.
* **Uber:** At Uber, Yuhki faced a major product decision: revealing upfront pricing. This bold move, initially met with internal resistance, ultimately proved successful, highlighting the importance of trust and transparency with users.
* **Figma:** Yuhki's decision to join Figma was driven by his belief in their vision of democratizing design. He saw a company breaking down barriers between disciplines and promoting collaboration, aligning perfectly with his own worldview.

**Embracing Change and the Future of Design**

Yuhki acknowledges the transformative shift happening in the world of design, driven by accessibility, AI, and the blurring of lines between disciplines. He envisions a future where more people can participate in the creative process, empowered by tools like Figma. 

**Key Quote:** 

> "People understanding what problem they're solving, people feeling really excited to work on it - those are only possible with really great stories, uh, with really great storytelling."

Yuhki's insights offer a powerful reminder that storytelling is not just a marketing tool; it's the foundation for successful product development. By focusing on narrative, understanding user needs, and building a shared vision, product managers can inspire their teams and create products that truly resonate with users.
