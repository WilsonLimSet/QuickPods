## The Future of AI: A Conversation with Alex Wang, CEO of Scale AI

In a recent episode of my podcast, I had the pleasure of hosting Alex Wang, the brilliant CEO of Scale AI, a company at the forefront of data infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Our conversation, which you can listen to above, provided some truly fascinating insights into the present and future of the AI industry. Here are some of the key takeaways:

### Diminishing Returns and the Data Wall

One of the most pressing questions in AI today is whether we're seeing diminishing returns on investment in compute. While investment in hardware like Nvidia GPUs has skyrocketed, the progress in model capabilities has seemingly plateaued since the release of GPT-4. Alex argues that we've hit a "data wall." 

* We've essentially used up all the easily accessible data on the open internet.
* Models are now incredibly good at emulating the internet, but AGI (artificial general intelligence) requires much more than just internet data.
* To achieve true AGI, we need "frontier data" that encapsulates complex reasoning chains, discussions, and tool usage – the kind of data that doesn't get written down on the internet.

###  Unlocking Frontier Data:  A Human-Synthetic Approach

So, how do we overcome this data wall and unlock the potential of frontier data? Alex believes the solution lies in a two-pronged approach:

**1. Mining Existing Data:** Large enterprises like JP Morgan hold massive, proprietary datasets that dwarf the size of the internet datasets used to train GPT-4. This data represents a potential gold mine for AI, but it will never be open-sourced. The solution, Alex suggests, is for each enterprise to mine and refine its own data for specific AI applications tailored to their needs.

**2.  Data Production – A Human-Synthetic Hybrid:**  To move beyond existing data, we need a new means of production for frontier data.  This involves a hybrid approach:

* **Algorithms to do the heavy lifting:**  Algorithms can generate large amounts of synthetic data, but…
* **Human experts to guide the way:** …experts are needed to provide direction, correct errors, and ensure high data quality. 

This echoes the approach used in the development of autonomous vehicles, where safety drivers are essential for guiding and correcting AI systems.

###  The Rise of Data Strategy and the Future of Competition

This emphasis on data production and proprietary data has significant implications for the future of the AI industry:

* **Data strategy will be key:** Just as companies invest in building fabs for chip production, they will need to invest in developing data strategies to fuel their AI efforts. 
* **Moats will be built on data:**  While algorithms and compute power are more easily replicable, proprietary datasets will provide a sustainable competitive advantage in the AI race.

Alex predicts that in the future, companies will brag about their data assets, not just their GPU count.  This shift in focus will drive differentiation and create a new playing field for competition.

###  The End of Per Seat Pricing and the Rise of On-Prem Models

Another prediction Alex shared was the decline of per seat pricing in favor of consumption-based pricing models. As AI agents become increasingly responsible for the work within an enterprise, charging per seat makes less sense. Instead, companies will pay for the value their AI systems deliver, regardless of the number of human users.

This focus on data ownership and value capture also points towards the rise of on-prem AI models.  Enterprises are acutely aware that their data might be their only differentiator in the AI world, and they’re understandably cautious about sharing it with cloud providers or model developers.  

This creates a huge opportunity for open-source and on-prem models like LLaMA. These models allow companies to build custom AI applications on top of their proprietary data, ensuring their data never leaves their control.

### The Military Implications of AI: A Looming Concern

One of the most sobering insights from our conversation was the potential military impact of AI.  Alex expressed concern about the possibility of totalitarian leaders leveraging advanced AI for aggressive purposes. 

> "At its core, this AI technology has the potential to be one of the greatest military assets that humanity has ever seen...potentially even more of a military asset than nukes."

This concern raises complex questions about the open-source nature of AI development and the potential need for closed systems to safeguard against misuse.

###  Key Takeaways for Founders

Finally, we discussed some essential company-building principles in the age of AI:

* **Focus on building a self-preserving ecosystem of talent:**  Recruiting and retaining A-players remains paramount, even when your company isn't "hot."
* **Divorce team hypergrowth from company hypergrowth:**  Doubling or tripling your team year-on-year can lead to a decline in quality and excellence.
* **Own your means of distribution:**  Traditional press often prioritizes sensationalism and clicks over nuance and education.  Focus on building your company's brand and telling your story directly.

This conversation with Alex was a powerful reminder of the transformative potential of AI, but also the challenges and risks that lie ahead.  As the industry evolves, companies and individuals alike must prioritize data strategy, talent development, and a clear-eyed understanding of both the opportunities and the potential pitfalls of this revolutionary technology.
