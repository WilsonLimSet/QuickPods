## The Unconventional Chess King: Lessons from a $1B Bootstrap Empire 

In the world of startups, venture capital is often seen as the holy grail, the fuel that ignites rapid growth. But Eric Allbest, co-founder and CEO of Chess.com, built a billion-dollar empire doing things differently. In a captivating conversation on the 20VC podcast, Eric shares his unconventional journey, offering insights on entrepreneurship, remote work, and finding self-worth beyond financial success. 

**The Early Hustle: It's in the Blood** 

Eric's entrepreneurial spirit manifested at a young age, a trait he inherited from his father. From selling candy bars at school to collecting beer cans for recycling, Eric was always hustling. This scrappy mindset would become the foundation for his future endeavors.

**Building Chess.com: From Ecommerce to Community to Global Phenomenon**

Chess.com wasn't Eric's first foray into the chess world. He started with a teaching business, then an ecommerce site selling chess equipment. Recognizing the limitations of paid acquisition, he pivoted to building a community, acquiring the coveted Chess.com domain out of bankruptcy for $56,000 - a bold move he considered a "no-brainer."  

* **The Power of Content:** Instead of pouring money into ads, Eric focused on creating valuable content that drove user engagement and SEO. From YouTube to Twitch to TikTok, Chess.com consistently embraced emerging platforms.
* **Product-Led Growth:**  A conversation with a friend, Keith, led to the creation of "Puzzle Rush," a game that hooked users with progressively challenging chess puzzles. This product, praised by Malcolm Gladwell, became a pivotal growth driver. 

**Remote From Day One: Crushing Egos, Enabling Life** 

Chess.com was remote from its inception, long before the pandemic normalized remote work. Eric champions this model for several reasons:

* **Global Talent Pool:**  Expanding the hiring pool beyond geographical limitations enables access to top talent worldwide.
* **Mission-Driven Culture:**  A strong mission transcends ego and politics, fostering collaboration and shared purpose.
* **Respect for Life:**  Remote work offers flexibility and autonomy, allowing employees to live fulfilling lives both inside and outside of work. 

"If you have an ego, this is the wrong place for you. Get out and go find somewhere you can serve yourself. The weight of our mission will crush you," says Eric. 

**Beyond Money: Finding Fulfillment and Self-Worth**

Perhaps the most surprising aspect of Eric's story is his candid indifference to money. He values experiences, security, and meeting needs, but financial gain doesn't drive him. "I appreciate money, but I don't love money. I'm not motivated by it. I don't care about it in the same way. I don't know why," Eric admits. 

He emphasizes the importance of finding self-worth internally, not through external validation like financial success: "If your entire self-worth is a reflection of other people, you'll always be chasing that mirror. You have to start with good, balanced self-worth and self-value."

**Key Takeaways**

* **Embrace constraints:** Bootstrapping forced Chess.com to be creative and resourceful, fostering a culture of efficient growth.
* **Focus on user value:**  Prioritizing content and product development over paid acquisition builds long-term sustainable growth.
* **Be open to serendipity:**  Recognizing and capitalizing on unforeseen events like the Queen's Gambit can accelerate growth.
* **Find fulfillment beyond money:** Building a company that aligns with your values and serves a larger purpose can create lasting impact and personal satisfaction.

Eric's story is a powerful reminder that there's no one-size-fits-all approach to building a successful company. By staying true to their mission, prioritizing their community, and embracing unconventional methods, Chess.com built a billion-dollar empire. And as Eric reminds us: **"The future is so exciting. Don't you want to see it?"**
