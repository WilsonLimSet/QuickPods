## The Two Kinds of Suffering: An Interview with Jack Kornfield

This interview with Buddhist teacher Jack Kornfield offered a fascinating exploration of mindfulness, emotions, and the power of intention. From his time training in the monasteries of Asia to his work as a therapist and speaker, Kornfield shared insights that can help us live with greater presence, compassion, and freedom.

**Training in the Wild Forest**

Kornfield's journey into Buddhism began as a way to avoid serving in the Vietnam War. Seeking an alternative path, he joined the Peace Corps and was assigned to Thailand, a Buddhist country. There, he met a great teacher and agreed to learn from him as a monk, living in a remote forest monastery on the border of Thailand and Laos.

This experience was a stark contrast to his Ivy League education. The rigorous training, which included meditation, alms rounds, and community work, challenged him in unexpected ways. He quickly realized that despite his peaceful nature, he harbored a deep well of anger.

**Facing the Fire of Anger**

Kornfield's teacher encouraged him to confront his anger head-on, advising him to "close the door and the two windows, wrap yourself in all your robes, and if you're going to be angry, do it right." This instruction marked the beginning of his training in dealing with difficult emotions.

**Key Takeaways on Dealing with Emotions:**

* **Trust Your Capacity for Presence:** Instead of suppressing or getting overwhelmed by emotions, learn to be present with them.
* **Expand Your Window of Tolerance:** Through mindfulness practices, you can expand your capacity to tolerate and be with difficult emotions.
* **Name Your Emotions:** To gain clarity and perspective, begin by simply naming the emotions that arise.
* **Make Space for Emotions:** Allow emotions to be present without judgment, becoming a mindful witness to their stories and energy.
* **Don't Take it Personally:** As you become more present, you realize emotions are part of the shared human experience, not just your personal burden.
* **Cultivate Compassion:** Practice loving-kindness meditation, wishing well-being to yourself and others, to cultivate a compassionate response.

**The Power of Intention**

Kornfield emphasized the importance of intention, highlighting its role in shaping our lives and influencing the world around us. He shared insightful stories, including:

* **The Story of the Candle and Stones:** Working with young men from street gangs, Kornfield used a simple ritual to help them acknowledge and honor the pain of losing friends to violence.
* **The Woman Who Chose Not to Pass on Bitterness:** A woman facing a difficult divorce resolved not to bequeath a legacy of bitterness to her children about their father. This decision to stop the cycle of suffering resonated deeply.

**Key Takeaways on Intention:**

* **Intention Shapes Karma:** The state of mind behind our actions matters as much as the actions themselves.
* **Set Deliberate Intentions:** Quiet your mind and consciously set intentions, both inwardly and outwardly, to steer your actions in a positive direction.
* **Acknowledge the Impact:** Notice the consequences of your actions, even those with good intentions, to refine your approach.
* **Remember Who You Are:** Regularly recall your deepest values and aspirations, letting them guide your choices and actions.

**Finding Communion and Connection**

Kornfield lamented the lack of genuine communion in our modern, always-on culture. He highlighted the importance of Sangha, the community of support found in every spiritual tradition. 

He emphasized that while individual inner work is crucial, we need each other to navigate the complexities of life and become more fully human. He stressed the power of honest conversation, vulnerability, and the art of receiving compliments with grace.

**The Transformative Power of Nature**

Kornfield spoke to the profound effect nature has on our minds, suggesting it helps us step out of the constant chatter of our modern lives and reconnect with a deeper dimension of our being. 

He reminded us that we are not our bodies, emotions, or thoughts. We are consciousness experiencing the mystery of life. Nature, like love, music, art, and sacred rituals, can open gateways to this deeper awareness.

**The Gift of Mindfulness**

Through stories and teachings, Kornfield conveyed the transformative power of mindfulness. He shared practical tools like mindful pauses, loving-kindness meditation, and even a technique to number your top ten mental "tunes" to gain perspective on recurring thought patterns.

He offered a free 40-day course on his website, jackkornfield.com, called Mindfulness Daily, to guide listeners in developing these practices.

**A Key Quote:**

> “The kind you run away from that follows you everywhere, and the kind that you face and that’s the gateway to freedom. If you’re interested, come in."

This interview offered a potent reminder that we have the power to choose how we respond to life's challenges. By cultivating mindfulness, compassion, and intention, we can move from a life of fear and reactivity to one of connection, presence, and genuine freedom.
