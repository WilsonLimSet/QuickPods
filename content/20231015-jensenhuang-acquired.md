## Nvidia's Jensen Huang: A Master of Anticipation and the Power of "How Hard Can It Be?"

This week's episode of Acquired was truly special, a deep dive into the history of Nvidia with none other than its founder and CEO, Jensen Huang. For anyone following the incredible rise of AI, this episode is a must-listen.

### From Near-Death Experiences to World Domination

The episode delves into Nvidia's early days, filled with near-death experiences and risky bets. One particularly compelling story involves the Riva 128 graphics chip. Facing financial ruin, Nvidia made the audacious decision to skip physical prototyping and commit their remaining funds to a production run based entirely on simulations.

- **Facing imminent failure, they bet everything on a single, meticulously simulated chip.**
- **This bold move forced them to innovate and ultimately led to their adoption of a groundbreaking hardware-accelerated pipeline for 3D rendering.**

This approach, born out of necessity, became a core principle for Nvidia. As Jensen explains, "When you push your chips in, what you're really doing is… when you bet the farm, you're saying, 'I'm going to take everything in the future, all the risky things, and I'm going to pull it in advance."

### The Data Center: A Vision Years Ahead

This philosophy of anticipation is exemplified by Nvidia's early entry into the data center market. Long before AI exploded, Jensen recognized that "the vast majority of computing would be done away from the computer itself." They invested in building data center products like GForce Now and remote graphics, paving the way for their eventual dominance in AI.

- **By the time OpenAI came along in 2015, Nvidia was uniquely positioned to power their AI research with its data center infrastructure.**

### Building a Company Like a Computing Stack

Beyond its strategic decisions, the episode explores Nvidia's unique company culture. Jensen views the company's structure as a computing stack, with each layer representing different teams and individuals. "Who reports to whom, or title is not related to anywhere you are in the stack. It just happens to be who is the best at running that module, on that function, on that layer," he explains.

- **Information is disseminated quickly and widely, empowering even junior employees to contribute to crucial decisions.**

### The Power of Learning (But Not Imitating)

Throughout the conversation, Jensen emphasizes the importance of learning from a wide range of sources, including competitors, but not blindly imitating them. He believes in developing your own unique strategies based on your specific context and goals.

### Embracing the "Emotional Trauma" of Building a Company

Perhaps the most poignant insight from the episode is Jensen's reflection on the emotional toll of building a company. He describes the vulnerability, challenges, embarrassment, and shame that come with the journey. Yet, he offers a powerful message of resilience and the importance of a strong support system. "I'm surrounded by these people that never one time gave up, and they never one time gave up on me, and that's the entire ball of wax," he shares.

### The Future of Work and the "Manufacturing of Intelligence"

Looking to the future, Jensen is optimistic about the potential of AI to create new opportunities and amplify human productivity. He acknowledges the inevitable bumps in the road but believes that embracing AI and learning to work with it is essential for both individuals and companies to thrive in this new era.

He concludes with a powerful statement that captures the essence of his entrepreneurial spirit: **"To this day… I trick my brain into thinking, 'How hard can it be?' Because you have to."**
