## TomoCredit: Building a Better Tomorrow for Immigrants

In a world driven by credit scores, TomoCredit is a beacon of hope for immigrants and international students navigating the financial landscape of the US. Founded by Kristy Kim, TomoCredit is a fintech AI startup based in San Francisco with a mission to provide access to credit for those who are traditionally shut out by the system.

### Overcoming the Credit Score Barrier

Kim's personal experience as an immigrant, facing repeated rejections due to lack of credit history, fueled her passion to create TomoCredit.  

**“Building TomoCredit feels like I’m building a painkiller for people who really need it."**

• Many immigrants arrive in the US with ambitious goals – to start businesses, study, or build a career. 
• However, the lack of a credit score presents a significant obstacle in achieving these goals, leading to rejections for credit cards, loans, and even apartments. 
• This can leave many feeling disheartened and questioning their place in the new society.

TomoCredit understands these struggles and aims to level the playing field by providing an alternative pathway to credit.

### How TomoCredit Works

TomoCredit utilizes a unique approach that sidesteps the traditional credit score system:

• Users connect their bank accounts and other financial accounts to TomoCredit.
• Tomo's AI-powered algorithms analyze the user's financial data, such as income, spending patterns, and disposable income.
• Based on this analysis, TomoCredit assigns a proprietary "Tomo Score" to each user.
• Users with high Tomo Scores are approved for credit regardless of their FICO score.

This approach allows TomoCredit to assess creditworthiness based on actual financial behavior rather than relying solely on a traditional credit score. 

### A Data-Driven, Privacy-Focused Approach

TomoCredit's approach is both data-driven and privacy-focused:

• The company utilizes its own risk capital to issue credit, demonstrating its confidence in its model.
• TomoCredit prioritizes user privacy and does not share any private or sensitive data with lenders.
• The data collected is used to train and refine Tomo's AI models, leading to more accurate and predictive creditworthiness assessments.

### Building a Brand for Immigrants

TomoCredit's commitment extends beyond simply providing credit access.  The company aims to become a symbol of empowerment for immigrants, fostering a sense of belonging and support within the community.

• TomoCredit seeks to be the "go-to" brand for immigrants needing financial services, whether for securing an apartment, purchasing a car, or achieving other financial goals.
• By creating a welcoming and inclusive environment, TomoCredit empowers immigrants to focus on pursuing their ambitions rather than getting bogged down by the intricacies of the credit system.

TomoCredit's success highlights the importance of innovation and inclusivity in the financial sector. By challenging the status quo and leveraging the power of data, TomoCredit is paving the way for a more equitable future where everyone has the opportunity to build a better tomorrow.

**"Nobody comes here to get a credit card or to get an auto loan. I think that's just tools to make your life convenient and I don't want the future generations of international students to get stuck and struggle because of these tools, 'cause I suffered with it and with Tomo, I hope no international students in the future have to get rejected anymore. So that's my hope for the future."**
