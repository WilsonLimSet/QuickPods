## How Future Billionaires Get Sh*t Done

In this insightful conversation, Michael Seibel and Dalton Caldwell dissect the habits and mindsets that propel future billionaires to success. Drawing upon their experiences as startup founders and mentors at Y Combinator, they offer practical advice for anyone striving to achieve ambitious goals. 

**The Power of Maker Mode:**

- **Deep Work is Key:** Inspired by Paul Graham's essay, "Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule," they emphasize the importance of uninterrupted blocks of time for deep, focused work. Just as programmers need to hold the entire codebase in their mind for effective coding, entrepreneurs need dedicated periods to tackle complex challenges. 
- **Minimize Distractions:** Constant interruptions, especially from email and meetings, can significantly impede productivity. The "lunch as FU" principle, where everything shuts down after lunch for focused work, is a prime example of how to create a maker schedule environment.
- **Apply Maker Mode Beyond Programming:** The concept of maker mode can be extended to other critical tasks, such as sales and customer interaction. Dedicate large blocks of time to these activities, avoiding the pitfalls of fragmented scheduling.

**What Future Billionaires Avoid:**

- **The Social Media Black Hole:** Social media can be a significant time sink, distracting entrepreneurs from their core mission. Successful founders often take extreme measures to minimize their social media usage, recognizing its addictive nature. 
- **The Mentor Trap:** While mentorship can be valuable, excessive focus on collecting mentors and advisors can become a distraction. Building and launching a product should be the primary focus, not endless rounds of feedback and credential gathering.
- **The Hedge:** Hedging your bets by keeping multiple options open (grad school, job offers, side projects) can dilute your efforts. True commitment and focus often separate successful founders from the rest.

**Embrace the Risk and Be Proud:**

Founders should acknowledge the inherent risk in pursuing ambitious goals.  Instead of trying to minimize risk, embrace it, dedicate yourself wholeheartedly to your chosen path, and be proud of the work you do, regardless of the outcome.

> **"If you're proud of the job you did, you know, if you if you had heart and you gave it your all and you feel like you learned stuff, then great job! And you should view this as an affirmative experience."** - Dalton Caldwell
