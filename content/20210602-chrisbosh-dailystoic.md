This applies to any field, whether it's writing, music, or sports. Bosh emphasizes the importance of "staying with it" and trusting the process, even when faced with setbacks.

### Embracing the Journey

Bosh's early retirement taught him invaluable lessons about life's fragility and the need to stay present. He emphasizes the importance of finding balance between ambition and enjoying the moment. 

 **Key Takeaways:**
