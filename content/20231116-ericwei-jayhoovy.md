## The Power of Letting Go: How To Find Your True Path To Success

In a world that constantly pushes external validation and pre-determined paths to success, it's easy to lose sight of what truly matters. This interview with Eric, a successful entrepreneur with a "star-studded" resume including Harvard, Blackstone, and McKinsey, reveals a powerful message about finding your true path.

**Prestige Doesn't Equal Happiness**

Eric candidly admits that chasing external validation led him down a path that, while impressive on paper, left him feeling unfulfilled. Despite achieving "life's dream" of attending Harvard, he felt lost and unsure of what he genuinely cared about. He jumped from Wall Street to McKinsey to tech, always looking for the "next ladder up" but never finding true satisfaction. 

This relentless pursuit of prestige was driven by a deep fear of what others thought and a lack of self-awareness about his own passions.

**Embrace the Uncertainty**

Eric draws a fascinating parallel between Kohlberg's moral system of reasoning and the journey of finding your passion. Just as our sense of morality evolves from self-interest to societal norms and ultimately to an independent code, our understanding of our own desires can undergo a similar transformation.

* **Childhood Dreams:** We start with a clear understanding of what we enjoy, our "childhood dreams."
* **Societal Influence:** We internalize societal expectations, losing sight of our inherent passions.
* **Reclaiming Agency:** We develop an independent sense of what matters to us, consciously choosing to prioritize our genuine desires over external validation.

This shift requires introspection, a willingness to challenge societal norms, and the courage to embrace uncertainty.

**Practical Steps to Success**

While Eric emphasizes the importance of introspection and letting go of external validation, he also offers practical advice for those seeking conventional success:

* **Speak with Industry Insiders:** Gain a deep understanding of your desired field by talking to those already working in it. This not only provides valuable insights but also helps build connections that could give you an edge.
* **Practice Makes Perfect:** Don't shy away from mock interviews. Embracing the discomfort of early feedback helps you identify vulnerabilities and improve your performance.
* **Embrace First Principles Thinking:** Break down problems into their foundational components, questioning assumptions and gaining a deep understanding of the underlying mechanics. This approach fosters innovation and helps you identify new solutions.

**Key Quote:**

> "Nobody knows what they're doing… If nobody knows what they’re doing, then it’s hard for anyone to come to you and say this is right, and it’s easier for you to care less about what other people think." - Eric

Ultimately, Eric's message is one of empowerment. By letting go of the need for external validation and embracing the uncertainty of the journey, we can unlock our true potential and find a path that leads to genuine fulfillment.
