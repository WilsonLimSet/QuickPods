## A Conversation with Adam Mosseri: The Future of Instagram and the Rise of the Creator

In this insightful conversation, Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, sits down with Colin and Samir to discuss the evolving landscape of Instagram, the rise of creators, and the challenges of monetization in the age of short-form video. 

### Instagram: Beyond the Square Photo

Mosseri acknowledges that while people often associate Instagram with a feed of square photos, the platform has dramatically shifted towards video consumption. Over half the time spent on Instagram is now dedicated to video, highlighting the platform's commitment to staying relevant and meeting user demand. 

* Stories, direct messaging (DMs), and Reels have been instrumental in Instagram's evolution and relevance.
* The platform strives to create a participatory, lean-in video experience distinct from YouTube and TikTok's lean-back models.
* This participatory approach is emphasized by the importance of "sends," reflecting the value of videos being shared and sparking conversations between users.

> "If you think about, if we had stuck with a feed of square photos, and we didn't have Stories, and we didn't have DMs, and we didn't have videos or Reels, we wouldn't be anywhere near as relevant as we are today."

### The Creator Economy: Power Shifts and Challenges

Mosseri believes that power is shifting from institutions to individuals across various industries, including sports, news, and music. Creators are driving more engagement and changing how audiences consume content. However, keeping creators happy presents its own set of challenges.

* **Reach and Consistency:** While creators prioritize reach, achieving consistent growth is difficult. Platforms guaranteeing stable reach are likely not being truthful, emphasizing the need for platforms to grow the "pie" and find ways to increase overall reach for creators.
* **Revenue Share:**  Monetization remains a key concern for creators, particularly those with smaller followings. Instagram is exploring revenue share models for short-form video, but it's proving more challenging than with long-form video due to attribution complexities and the need for financial sustainability.
* **Connecting Creators:** Building strong connections between creators and fans is crucial. Instagram leverages its robust DM system to facilitate these connections, recognizing the value of building relationships and fostering a sense of community.

### Instagram vs. TikTok: The Battle for Short-Form Video

While acknowledging TikTok's phenomenal success, Mosseri highlights Instagram's strengths in the battle for short-form video dominance.

* **Creative Freedom:** Instagram provides creators with a broader suite of tools and formats, offering more creative freedom compared to TikTok's primary focus on short-form videos.
* **Global Reach:**  Instagram's larger global platform offers greater potential reach for creators, especially those whose content transcends language barriers.
* **Learning from Competition:** TikTok's success has pushed Instagram to improve its exploration-based ranking system, giving smaller creators better opportunities for discovery and growth.

### The Future of Social Media: Fragmented Landscape and Wearable Tech

Mosseri sees a continued shift towards messaging-based formats and the rise of mobile video consumption, potentially eating into traditional TV's market share. He acknowledges the growing concerns about a fragmented internet, where platforms are banned in certain countries, highlighting the need for industry-wide solutions and parental consent for younger users.

* **Parental Controls:** Mosseri believes parental consent for social media use by teens should be an industry-wide practice, ideally implemented at the operating system or app store level for consistency and to minimize errors.
* **Wearable Tech:** The next few years will see a surge in wearable technology, bridging the gap between devices like the Ray-Ban Metas and VR headsets like the Quest. These new forms will likely change the way users engage with social media, shifting towards voice-driven interfaces.
* **The Next Big Shift:** Mosseri anticipates a significant shift in how people share content within the next 5 years, possibly driven by advancements in generative AI and the emergence of new formats or channels.

### Staying Relevant: Adapting to a Rapidly Changing World

Mosseri's biggest concern is the world evolving faster than platforms can keep up. He recognizes the challenges that come with growth – increased overhead, scrutiny, regulations, and the temptation to prioritize short-term gains over long-term vision. 

* **The Risk of Inertia:** Becoming too slow to adapt, clinging to past successes, and prioritizing short-term revenue over long-term vision can lead to platforms becoming irrelevant as the world moves on.
* **The Importance of Evolution:** Platforms need to embrace change, prioritize originality, and empower creators to find success and build sustainable careers to maintain cultural relevance and user trust.
* **Looking Ahead:** While predicting the future is difficult, Mosseri believes that adapting to a rapidly changing world and embracing new technologies will be crucial for the continued success of social media platforms like Instagram.

 Ultimately, Mosseri emphasizes the importance of staying true to the core values of connecting people around creativity and fostering a sense of community. This guiding principle, he believes, will be essential for Instagram's continued relevance and success in an ever-evolving digital landscape.

> "The reason why I am not interested in pursuing long-form video in a meaningful way is because I don't want to erode… our heart… like, our core reason to exist."
