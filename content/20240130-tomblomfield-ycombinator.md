## Choosing Your Path: Lessons from a Serial Entrepreneur

Have you ever looked around and felt stuck in the system? Do you ever wonder if there's a different way to do things, a chance to create something truly impactful? Tom Blomfield, co-founder of GoCardless and Monzo, knows this feeling well. In his insightful backstory, he shares his journey from a law student to a successful entrepreneur, navigating the highs and lows of building two billion-dollar companies.

### The Road Less Traveled

Blomfield's path wasn't linear. Despite pressure to pursue a traditional career in law, his passion for technology and building things led him to drop out of a promising startup and ultimately, leave a secure job. This decision, though difficult, allowed him to truly embrace his entrepreneurial spirit.

* He learned valuable lessons at Y Combinator, realizing the importance of setting the bar high and constantly pushing himself and his team.
* He experienced the emotional rollercoaster of building a company, from the exhilaration of early successes to the gut-wrenching fear of potential failure. 
* He found strength in vulnerability, uniting his team by openly sharing challenges and working tirelessly together to overcome them.

### The Power of Impact

Throughout his journey, Blomfield remained driven by a desire to make a tangible difference. He found that focusing on solving problems close to his heart, problems that frustrated him personally, ignited a passion that fueled his work.

* This drive resonated with customers, investors, and even the press, propelling both GoCardless and Monzo to remarkable growth. 
* It wasn't always smooth sailing - he faced death threats, regulatory hurdles, and the immense pressure of building critical infrastructure that impacted millions.
* Ultimately, his commitment to creating a better, more user-friendly banking experience paid off, with Monzo achieving profitability and becoming a major player in the UK market. 

###  Embracing the Unknown

Blomfield's story isn't just about building companies; it's about choosing a path less traveled, embracing the unknown, and finding fulfillment in creating something new. He reminds us that we all have the potential to make a difference, to break down existing structures, and redefine the rules.

**"No smarter or harder working than you or me - you have the chance to create something, to define the rules, and make the world a little different."**
