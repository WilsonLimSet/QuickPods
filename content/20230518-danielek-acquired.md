## The Unexpected Power of Audio: An Interview with Spotify's Daniel Ek

This week on Acquired, we sat down with Daniel Ek, the man behind Spotify, who essentially saved the music industry from the wreckage of the Napster era. Ek's insights into the future of audio, how Spotify has grown to over 500 million users, and the cultural shifts happening in the creative economy are thought-provoking, inspiring, and even a little bit terrifying. 

### The Genius of the Obvious

One of the most fascinating things about Spotify's journey is how they've repeatedly found success by doing the seemingly "obvious." Take the integration of podcasts into the Spotify app. When they first announced this move, most industry experts insisted podcasts needed their own dedicated space. 

* The prevailing wisdom was the "constellation of apps," a separate app for everything. 
* Ek, however, saw the user experience first: people simply wanted to consume audio content seamlessly. 
* This "obvious" insight led to the seismic shift in the podcasting ecosystem we're experiencing today, with Spotify becoming a dominant platform for the medium.

This same approach applies to their current exploration of audiobooks. While the line between podcasts and audiobooks is blurring, Ek believes the key differentiator is the business model.

* Podcasts = ad-supported audio
* Audiobooks = paid audio

He predicts that audiobooks will become a much larger market, but challenges remain:

* **Discovery:** Finding the right audiobook is a major pain point for consumers.
* **Business Model:** The current paid model limits market size and potential. 

### Culture, Creativity, and AI

Ek believes that artists today are inherently entrepreneurs, and the most successful ones deeply understand their audience and business. The rise of streaming has created new opportunities for artists to reach global audiences, but it's also forced them to think creatively about monetization.

* Streaming revenue alone may not replace what artists made during the CD era.
* Building a unique "constellation" of revenue streams is key.
* Authenticity to the artist and audience is crucial for any strategy to work.

The interview then delves into the profound impact of AI on the creative landscape. 

* AI will likely unlock another "order of magnitude of simplicity" for creation.
* Platforms like Spotify have a role to play in verifying authenticity in an AI-driven world.
* The cost of AI-generated content, however, presents challenges for widespread adoption.

### The Importance of Building a Unique Culture

Perhaps the most valuable takeaway from the interview is Ek's emphasis on intentionally building a company culture. He admits that early Spotify tried to emulate the cultures of iconic companies like Google and Amazon, leading to a Frankenstein-like monstrosity. 

* The key is to "really, really think through" and be "diligent about the culture you create."
* Recognizing the trade-offs of each cultural expression is crucial.
* Understanding when to iterate and when to make a bold move is essential.

Ultimately, Ek believes that Spotify is only now truly defining its own unique culture, one that's rooted in supporting creators and understanding the nuanced needs of different audiences. He's confident that the next decade will be even more exciting for the audio world and for Spotify's journey.

**"And honestly, that's probably just a training problem...And again, the largest problem today is the cost per minute uh would be too high for most podcast... But it's huge in terms of like moving our metrics um in a pretty substantial way."**
