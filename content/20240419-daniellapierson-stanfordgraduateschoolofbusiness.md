## Interview with Danielle Pierson, CEO and Founder of The Newsette

Danielle Pierson discusses her journey from feeling like the "dumb twin" to becoming a young self-made millionaire and the CEO of The Newsette, a successful media company.

## Overcoming a Rough Start

Danielle struggled academically and felt overshadowed by her twin sister, who excelled in school. Despite these challenges, with the encouragement of her parents—who hailed from very different backgrounds—she found her own path to success.

## Finding Her Passion Through a Newsletter

While in college, Danielle started a newsletter as she found websites too complicated to handle. This newsletter allowed her to connect directly with her audience, ultimately building a loyal following. This simple but effective approach proved to be a brilliant move.

## Bootstrapping Her Way to the Top

As a young founder without a prestigious degree or venture capital funding, Danielle faced many challenges. However, she managed to bootstrap her way to success. She utilized creative tactics such as reaching out to potential subscribers on Facebook and strategically avoided partnering with advertisers until after her graduation.

## Success on Her Own Terms

Danielle emphasizes that success can be defined in various ways. She advocates for finding a purpose beyond merely making money and stresses the importance of perseverance through difficulties.

> Just because you have all these barriers that history and statistics say will not work for success, you can actually make a new recipe. That's why I built 'Be a Bread Winner' and why I'm so excited for its launch. It really is for somebody who wants to have success on their own terms and be a barrier breaker, a bread taker, the new mold of a money maker."

This quote encapsulates Danielle's philosophy of defying expectations and forging your own path to success.
