## Shaq: More Than a Superman

Shaquille O'Neal, the towering NBA legend, is more than just a dominant force on the court. He's a businessman, a philanthropist, a father, and a man who lives by the principles instilled in him by his father. In a recent interview, Shaq opened up about his life, offering valuable insights into his competitive drive, his unique relationship with Kobe Bryant, and the importance of staying true to yourself. 

### The Making of Shaq

From a young age, Shaq's size made him stand out. He shared that he was 7 feet tall and getting bullied all the time until, well, he became the bully. Ironically, the bullies weren't guys, but girls! He eventually found solace and strength in basketball, guided by a father who was a drill sergeant. This instilled in Shaq a strong work ethic and a commitment to achieving his goals, especially the goal of taking care of his mother. 

* Shaq's father instilled in him the importance of honor, respect, dignity, and pride. 
* He also stressed the importance of charity, teaching Shaq to help those in need. 
* Shaq's drive stemmed from a deep desire to provide for his mother. 

### Shaq and Kobe: A Powerful Dynamic

Shaq and Kobe Bryant's time with the Lakers was legendary. They dominated the league, winning championships year after year. But their relationship was complex, fueled by a competitive fire that often spilled over into on-court tension. Shaq admitted to pushing Kobe's buttons, knowing that it would ultimately bring out the best in him. 

* Shaq acknowledged Kobe's alien-like work ethic, describing his relentless practice routine. 
* He compared their differences: Kobe was obsessed with being the best ever, while Shaq was obsessed with being the most dominant.
* Their on-court tension was a tactic used to motivate each other, never personal hatred.
* Coach Phil Jackson rarely intervened in their clashes, recognizing the positive impact of their fierce competition. 

### A Winning Mentality On and Off the Court

Shaq's success transcends the basketball court. He's built an impressive business empire, owning a diverse portfolio of companies.  He credits his upbringing and mindset for his success, emphasizing the importance of staying true to yourself and finding success on your own terms. 

* He advises aspiring entrepreneurs to learn the market, learn from failures, and work with smart people. 
* Most importantly, he stresses the need for mental strength and unwavering self-belief. 

### Shaq's Legacy

Shaq's charitable endeavors are well documented. He frequently makes headlines for acts of kindness, like buying wedding rings for strangers or making a Make-A-Wish kid's day. He attributes this philanthropic spirit to lessons learned from his father. 

* Shaq prioritizes family, raising his children with similar values and principles instilled in him. 
* He instills the value of hard work and education in his children, not wanting them to solely rely on his wealth. 

Shaq's journey is a testament to the power of dedication, resilience, and staying true to oneself.  He leaves us with a powerful reminder:

> **"When I'm playing, I'm on that court, you can't outplay me because if you are, you're taking my mother's house away. And I can't have that. So I will damn there kill you... I will damn there kill you before I let you take my mother's house away."**
