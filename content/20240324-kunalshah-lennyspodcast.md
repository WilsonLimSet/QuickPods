## The Indian CEO Enigma and the Power of Dharma: Unexpected Insights from Kunal Shah

Today, we delve into the fascinating world of Indian entrepreneurship with Kunal Shah, CEO and founder of the Indian fintech giant, CRED. Kunal, renowned for his insightful perspectives on product and life, generously shared a wealth of wisdom during our conversation, exploring the nuances of the Indian market and what sets it apart from the global stage. Prepare to have your assumptions challenged and learn a thing or two about the power of long-term thinking, curiosity, and even the role of ancient mythology in modern business.

### The Delta 4 Framework: Redefining Product Success

Forget 10x better – Kunal’s Delta 4 framework provides a pragmatic and measurable approach to product innovation. He argues that true product success lies in achieving an efficiency delta of at least four points compared to existing solutions. Only then does a product become truly irreversible, highly tolerant to failure, and a unique bragging point (UBP) for users. Think Uber vs. traditional taxis, or the recent explosion of OpenAI and LLMs – these are all examples of Delta 4 in action, where the efficiency gains are so substantial they spark organic excitement and adoption.

### The Rise of Indian CEOs: Dharma, Humility, and Sustaining Legacy

Why are Indian immigrants so successful in leading US tech companies? Kunal, who has had the opportunity to interact with many of these individuals, offers a compelling framework rooted in Indian mythology. He explains that these CEOs often embody the traits of “Lord Rama,” known for principled obedience and upholding Dharma, the core principles of a company's founder. They prioritize sustaining the company’s legacy over imposing their own identity, fostering long-term stability and growth.

- **Humility is key:** These leaders recognize the value of the foundation they inherited and strive to enhance it, rather than seeking to revolutionize it for personal recognition.
- **Dharma over ego:** They embody the company’s core values and avoid diluting the founder’s vision, ensuring long-term sustainability.

### Navigating the Indian Market: DAUs, ARPU, and the Concentration of Trust

Building in India comes with its own set of challenges and opportunities.

- **DAUs are easy, ARPU is hard:** India's low per capita income makes it relatively simple to acquire users (DAUs) but extremely difficult to monetize them (ARPU). This has implications for product strategy, as Indian founders often need to think about global expansion to achieve profitability.
- **The Concentration of Trust:** India, like many developing nations, operates as a low-trust society. Consumers are wary of new brands and institutions, leading to a concentration of trust in established brands and "super apps." This means building brand credibility is paramount, while focus on a single product can be limiting.

### Embracing Curiosity and Second-Order Thinking

Kunal emphasizes the importance of staying curious and embracing second-order thinking to navigate the ever-changing landscape of business and life.

- **Curiosity fuels growth:** It allows us to challenge assumptions, adapt to new challenges, and continuously accumulate knowledge, creating valuable information asymmetry.
- **Second-order thinking:** The ability to anticipate the ripple effects of events, crucial for making sound decisions in an unpredictable world. Kunal uses hypothetical scenarios to assess candidates’ ability to engage in this type of thinking.

### Learning from Failures and the Power of Sharing

Kunal believes that entrepreneurs have a unique ability to learn from failures and distill valuable lessons. He encourages founders to embrace this process, learn from others’ mistakes, and share their own experiences to accelerate collective growth.

- **Failure is inevitable, forgetting is optional:** Don't dwell on the memory of failure, but extract the lesson and move forward.
- **Share your evolution:** Contribute to the community by openly sharing your learnings and insights, reducing information asymmetry and helping others avoid similar pitfalls.

### The Takeaway: Building for the Future, Embracing the Journey

Kunal’s insights challenge conventional wisdom and offer a unique perspective on the world of business, particularly within the dynamic Indian market. He leaves us with a powerful call to action:

> “Please share what you are learning…There are many, many people who are learning only because you share your evolution and your thoughts… If they all shared, many people from many places in the world would learn… and achieve some amount of success. Thanks to your sharing.” - Kunal Shah
