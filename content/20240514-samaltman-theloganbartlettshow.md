## The Strangely Isolating Reality of Leading AI: A Conversation with Sam Altman

This week on the Logan Bartlett Show, the conversation took a fascinating turn with OpenAI's CEO and Co-founder, Sam Altman. We didn't just discuss the usual business strategies and lessons learned â€“ we dove deep into the heart of artificial intelligence, its impact on the world, and what it means to be at the forefront of this technological revolution.

### A World Transformed, Not by Action, but by Expectations

Sam's insights were unexpected and thought-provoking. He surprisingly revealed that one of the biggest changes in his life wasn't the success of OpenAI, but the isolating nature of fame that came with it. While he believed in the power of AI and OpenAI's business, he admits he hadn't anticipated the very personal impact on his day-to-day life.

Speaking about ChatGPT's impact on the world, he noted:

> "I don't think you can find much evidence in the economic measurement of your choice that ChatGPT really inflected productivity or whatever...maybe customer support. Maybe some, maybe some areas. Some areas. But like if you look at like global GDP, you know, can you detect when ChatGPT launched? Probably not."

While ChatGPT hasn't drastically altered our productivity metrics (yet), Sam believes it's fundamentally shifted our _expectations_ about the future. We're no longer surprised by AI's capabilities, and this change in mindset is perhaps the most impactful change of all.

### The Future of AI: It's All About Reasoning

Looking towards the future, Sam sees generalized models with reasoning abilities as the key to unlocking AI's true potential. While specialized models are useful, their limited scope pales in comparison to models that can learn and adapt to new information and data types.

He firmly believes that:

- **Generalized reasoning is the core of AI advancement.** This ability will enable AI to work with new data and solve new problems, regardless of the specific task at hand.
- **The impact of AI on GDP will be visible in the long term.** While ChatGPT hasn't caused a noticeable shift yet, the cumulative effect of AI advancements over the next few decades will likely be undeniable.
- **The future of AI business is rooted in traditional business principles.** UI/UX and ease of use will still matter. Building defensible businesses that leverage AI, rather than just focusing on the AI itself, will be key.

### OpenAI's Structure, Open Source, and Safety: A Balancing Act

The conversation also touched on the recent restructuring of OpenAI, the rise of open-source models, and concerns around AI safety. Here are a few key takeaways:

- **OpenAI is actively working on a new structure.** Sam acknowledged the limitations of their existing structure and reassured listeners that changes are in progress.
- **Open source has its place in the AI landscape.** While acknowledging the potential dangers, Sam is not fundamentally opposed to open-source models. He believes there's room for both open-source and closed-source models to coexist.
- **Regulation is crucial, but timing is everything.** He emphasized the need for oversight when AI models pose significant risks to the world, but also warned against stifling innovation by prematurely regulating current capabilities.

### Humanity in a World of AI: The Power of Connection

While the conversation covered complex technical topics, it ultimately ended on a surprisingly human note. Sam shared a poignant anecdote about a surreal moment during a stressful period, where he realized how quickly we adapt to even the most extraordinary circumstances.

This story, coupled with his thoughts on the future of human interaction, highlighted an important truth:

> "Human adaptability to almost anything is just like much, much more remarkably strong than we realize. And you can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast."

Even in a world where AI can replicate creative work, solve complex problems, and even write our emails, it's our connections with other humans that truly define us.

This interview with Sam Altman was a powerful reminder that the future of AI is not just about the technology itself, but about how we choose to use it and how we adapt to its evolving capabilities.
