## Keith Rabois on Seed Investing, Avoiding Competition, and Why Remote Work is a "Horrible Idea"

In this engaging conversation, Keith Rabois, a renowned investor and member of the PayPal Mafia, shares his insights on seed investing, company building, and the future of Fintech. With a career spanning decades, Rabois offers a unique perspective based on his experience as an operator, executive, angel investor, and venture capitalist. 

### The Allure of Seed Investing

Rabois explains his passion for seed investing, highlighting two key reasons:

* **Economic Advantage:** He believes he possesses a comparative advantage in identifying and evaluating founders at the earliest stages, a skill that becomes increasingly valuable as the availability of data and metrics increases. 
* **Impact:** Early involvement allows him to guide founders, preventing unnecessary solidifying of ideas and increasing the probability of success. 

Rabois also discusses the challenges of allocating time effectively when dealing with the sheer volume of pre-seed and seed stage companies. He admits that his biggest mistakes as an investor stemmed from declining meetings with founders who later proved to be exceptional.

###  Iconic Investments: Ramp and Rome

Rabois dives into two of his most notable seed investments:

* **Ramp:** A corporate card company that challenged an established player in a seemingly crowded market. He saw an opportunity despite the perceived risk, believing in the team's ability to execute a differentiated strategy. This investment exemplifies Rabois's willingness to bet on strong founders even in seemingly competitive landscapes.
* **Rome:**  A company enabling mortgage transfers, addressing the issue of homeowners locked into low interest rates hindering their ability to relocate. Rabois, drawing from his OpenDoor experience, saw a clear market need and a unique solution. 

These investments showcase Rabois's contrarian approach and his ability to identify opportunities where others see only challenges.

### Avoiding Competition is Key

Throughout the conversation, Rabois emphasizes his belief that "competition is for losers." He prefers identifying unique opportunities and avoiding direct competition. He cites the importance of:

* **Underwriting Advantage:**  Finding a unique angle to assess and manage risk, particularly in Fintech.
* **Distribution Advantage:**  Creating an unfair distribution strategy to reach the target market effectively.

He uses PayPal's success as a prime example, highlighting their unique underwriting approach and their powerful distribution advantage through eBay. 

### Building Companies: People and Culture

Rabois offers valuable advice for company builders, focusing on the importance of the "barrel concept." He argues that:

* **Barrels, not Ammunition:**  Most hires are ammunition, not barrels â€“ individuals who can execute on existing ideas, but not necessarily drive new initiatives. Companies should prioritize recruiting "barrels," individuals capable of leading from inception to execution.
* **Remote Work Limitations:** Rabois expresses strong reservations about remote-first companies, emphasizing the crucial role of in-person interactions for learning by osmosis, especially for early-stage companies with less experienced talent.

He acknowledges the potential for distributed offices, but maintains that remote work is only viable for specific companies, particularly those built on open-source platforms. 

### Beyond the Bay Area

While acknowledging the historical success of Silicon Valley, Rabois believes that the Bay Area, particularly San Francisco, is currently overrated. He suggests that:

* **South Bay Advantage:** The South Bay offers a better cultural environment, with more mission-driven companies and a focus on long-term value creation.
* **Global Opportunities:** The internet has enabled the spread of information and capital access globally, creating opportunities for innovation outside traditional tech hubs.

He points to his firm's investments in AI companies outside the Bay Area, highlighting the global nature of innovation and the emergence of new centers of excellence. 

###  Key Takeaways

Rabois's conversation is packed with insights and thought-provoking ideas. His perspective, shaped by decades of experience, challenges conventional wisdom and offers valuable guidance for both founders and investors.  

**Key Quote:** "You don't want to copy. The last thing a founder wants to do is copy any practices from a monopoly because almost surely they do not have a monopoly."
