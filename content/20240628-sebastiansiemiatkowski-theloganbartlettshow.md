## Klarna CEO: The Unexpected Value of Honesty and Hard Work

In a candid conversation with Logan Bartlett, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, co-founder and CEO of the global payments platform Klarna, pulls back the curtain on the tumultuous journey of building a successful tech business. From navigating the delicate balance between internal momentum, public perception, and financial results to wrestling with personal demons and leadership challenges, Siemiatkowski offers refreshingly honest insights that resonate far beyond the tech world.

### The Three Barometers of Success

Siemiatkowski highlights three key indicators of a company's success, each with its own distinct timeline:

* **Internal momentum:** The energy and drive within the organization, often seen in the pace of product development and the quality of work. 
* **Profit & Loss (P&L) results:** The financial performance of the business, lagging behind internal momentum as it takes time for successes to translate into concrete results.
* **Public perception:** How the market views the company's success, influenced by a combination of internal momentum and P&L results, often with a delay.

He cautions founders that these indicators can become temporarily disconnected, leading to internal conflict and external pressure. Klarna's own experience with a soaring $50 billion valuation while struggling to build a global PSP business exemplified this disconnect.

### The Radical Honesty of Facing Your Demons

In a refreshing departure from the typical CEO narrative, Siemiatkowski opens up about his personal struggle with alcohol and the profound impact it had on his life and leadership.  His decision to stop drinking was driven by a choice of love, prioritizing his relationship with his wife over the party lifestyle. 

**"At some point of time, my wife told me like, 'Look, if you're gonna continue partying this hard, like I'm out.'"**

He describes the physical and emotional toll of overcoming addiction, comparing it to a cancer survival experience. This journey ultimately led to a renewed sense of purpose and a deeper understanding of himself and his values.

### Building a Culture of Hard Work and Discipline

Siemiatkowski emphasizes the importance of establishing a culture of hard work and discipline, especially in the early days of a company. He recounts how Klarna's founders, driven by a suspicion of each other slacking off, implemented an "open-screen policy" and tracked their working hours to ensure equal effort. While this approach might raise eyebrows in today's world of work-life balance, he argues that it was crucial for instilling a sense of commitment and accountability.

### The Lessons Learned From Competition

Siemiatkowski reflects on Klarna's experience trying to build a global PSP business and ultimately losing out to competitors like Adyen and Stripe. He attributes their success to a laser focus on product development and execution, while Klarna spread itself too thin. He stresses the importance of recognizing one's strengths and weaknesses and being willing to pivot when necessary.

### Embracing the Hard Stuff

Siemiatkowski makes a compelling case for tackling difficult challenges head-on, especially when it comes to regulation and compliance. He argues that embracing these complexities, rather than viewing them as obstacles, can lead to valuable learnings and a stronger foundation for the business. He cites Klarna's experience obtaining a banking license and proactively engaging with regulators as an example of this philosophy.

### Trust, Long-term Vision, and the Importance of People

Siemiatkowski shares his perspective on working with venture capitalists, highlighting the importance of trust, long-term vision, and the human element. He praises Sequoia Capital and Mike Moritz in particular for their enduring support, strategic guidance, and ability to cut through the noise to focus on what truly matters. He emphasizes that strong personal relationships and shared values are crucial for navigating the complexities of building a successful business.

**"I think it’s still a lot about the person and not the firm. You will have different people, and it’s all about that personal rapport."**

Siemiatkowski's candid reflections offer valuable lessons for anyone navigating the rollercoaster of entrepreneurship. His emphasis on honesty, hard work, and the power of human connection are essential ingredients for building a business that not only generates profit but also creates lasting value for customers and society alike.
