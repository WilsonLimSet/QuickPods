## The Untold Story of Bastian Schweinsteiger's Manchester United Nightmare

Bastian Schweinsteiger's move to Manchester United was meant to be a dream come true for the World Cup winner. After achieving everything possible with Bayern Munich, he wanted a new challenge, and what bigger challenge than to play for the most successful club in English football?

But the dream quickly turned into a nightmare. In this candid conversation, Schweinsteiger reveals for the first time the shocking treatment he endured under Jose Mourinho and sheds light on the cultural issues that have plagued Manchester United for the last decade.

### A Shocking Dismissal

Just a year after winning the FA Cup in his first season, Schweinsteiger returned from the Euros to find himself frozen out of the first team by new manager, Jose Mourinho. The World Cup winner was banned from the dressing room, forced to train with the under-16s, and essentially erased from the first team picture.

**Here are some of the most shocking revelations:**

- **Banned from the Dressing Room**: On his birthday, Schweinsteiger was told by assistant manager John Murther that he was no longer allowed in the first team dressing room, without any prior warning or explanation.
- **Training with the Under-16s**: Mourinho relegated Schweinsteiger to train with the youth team, a move described by Gary Neville as "illegal" and "constructive dismissal."
- **Three Months of Isolation**: Schweinsteiger trained alone for three months, prohibited from joining first-team sessions.
- **Mourinho's Justification**: Mourinho's only explanation for his actions was that he didn't "see [Schweinsteiger] happy" due to his decision to rehab his injury with German doctors.
- **An Apology Too Late**: Mourinho only apologized for his treatment of Schweinsteiger when the player was leaving for Chicago Fire, admitting he "could not do anything against my decision again."

### A Culture of Disrespect

Schweinsteiger’s experience reveals a disturbing lack of respect for players at Manchester United, a sentiment echoed by Neville. If a World Cup winner like Schweinsteiger could be treated this way, what message did it send to the rest of the squad?

Neville also expressed embarrassment at the club's handling of the situation, stating there is "a way to do things, a way to behave, a way to act."

### The Problem with United

The conversation goes beyond Schweinsteiger's personal experience, delving into a broader discussion about the cultural issues that have plagued Manchester United post-Sir Alex Ferguson.

**Key talking points:**

- **The Mourinho Paradox**: Schweinsteiger enjoyed playing under Mourinho despite his treatment, recognizing his tactical genius and ability to adapt his style based on the team.
- **Lack of Identity**: Schweinsteiger and Neville express concerns about Manchester United’s lack of identity and values in the post-Ferguson era.
- **The "Graveyard" for Players**: Neville describes Manchester United as a “graveyard for good players”, where great managers and players have failed to achieve success.
- **The Pep Effect**: Both agree that German football lost its identity by trying to copy Pep Guardiola's style, neglecting traditional values like resilience and aggression.

### Schweinsteiger's United Dream – Could it Have Worked?

Despite his ordeal, Schweinsteiger remained a firm believer in the quality of the Manchester United squad he played in. He argues that with the right management, they had the potential to achieve success.

He even outlines his ideal starting XI:

- **Goalkeeper**: De Gea
- **Defenders**: Valencia, Shaw, Smalling, Rojo
- **Midfielders**: Pogba, Schweinsteiger, Carrick
- **Forwards**: Rooney, Ibrahimovic, Rashford

"We would have had success 100%, 100%," Schweinsteiger insists, highlighting the individual brilliance within the team. So what was missing? "We just needed to put the puzzle together," he concludes, suggesting a lack of cohesion and direction.

### A Look to the Future

Despite the disappointments, Schweinsteiger remains a Manchester United fan at heart. He hopes the club can rediscover its identity and return to its former glory. He believes players like Marcus Rashford have the potential to be world class, but they need the right environment to thrive.

Ultimately, Schweinsteiger's experience serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the importance of strong leadership, clear values, and respectful treatment of players for any club to succeed.
