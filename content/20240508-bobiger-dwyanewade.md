##  The Unquenchable Fire: A Conversation with Bob Iger

Dwayne Wade sat down with entertainment titan Bob Iger, former CEO of Disney, for a candid conversation on The Y podcast. Iger, who famously returned to the helm of Disney after a brief retirement, offered a unique perspective on leadership, legacy, and the importance of staying true to oneself amidst the pressures of a high-profile life. 

### A Love Deeper Than Position

Iger's return to Disney after a planned retirement speaks volumes about his deep connection to the company. While many may perceive it as simply a high-powered position, for Iger it's a personal commitment to a mission that resonates deeply: creating happiness. This, he explains, is the core of Disney, and the ability to bring joy to millions across the globe is ultimately what fuels his passion. 

* **A global impact:**  Iger shares a recent experience from Shanghai Disneyland, highlighting the company's global reach and the joy it brings to diverse cultures. 
* **Creating joy as a fuel:** He likens the experience of bringing happiness to others as "addictive" and "intoxicating," a feeling that keeps him engaged and driven.
* **A powerful sense of purpose:** This mission, he argues, provides a deep sense of purpose, a fulfillment that extends beyond the traditional confines of a job. 

###  The Grueling Climb to the Top

Iger's journey to the CEO position wasn't paved with roses. He faced a rigorous and "arduous" selection process, undergoing numerous interviews and scrutiny from the board. This experience, though challenging, forced him to define his priorities, assess the company's needs, and ultimately develop a clear vision for Disney's future.

* **The internal candidate:** While he was the internal candidate, multiple external candidates posed a significant challenge.
* **A time of uncertainty:** Disney's performance during the preceding years led to doubts about Iger's ability to lead the company forward.
* **A grueling process:** He endured countless interviews, proving his capabilities and articulating his vision for Disney.

### Navigating the Public Eye

Being in the public spotlight comes with its challenges, and both Wade and Iger acknowledge the difficulties of managing public perception. Iger, despite being an introvert at heart, learned to embrace the "stage" aspect of his role while prioritizing authenticity and staying true to his values. He avoids dwelling on external opinions and focuses on maintaining his integrity.

* **The introverted leader:** Despite the extroverted nature of his role, Iger acknowledges his introverted tendencies and the value they bring to his leadership style.
* **Blocking out the noise:**  He consciously avoids reading comments and articles about himself, choosing to focus on his own self-assessment and staying true to his values. 
* **Living up to your own standards:**  Ultimately, he believes that living up to your own standards is crucial. He strives to be kind and decisive while recognizing the need to make tough decisions. 

###  Finding Balance and Avoiding Regret

Striking a balance between professional success and personal life is a universal struggle, especially for high-achievers. Iger openly shares his regrets about not being fully present for his older children and emphasizes the importance of prioritizing family. He learned from his past experiences and made a conscious effort to be more present for his younger children, demonstrating a commitment to creating a fulfilling life beyond his professional achievements.

* **The guilt of missed moments:** He acknowledges the lingering guilt he feels from missing moments with his older children during his relentless pursuit of success. 
* **A conscious effort to change:** With his younger children, Iger prioritized presence, even amidst his demanding schedule, recognizing the need for balance. 
* **The importance of a supportive partner:** He credits his wife, Willow Bay, for her understanding and support in navigating the demands of his career and personal life.

### The Enduring Power of Legacy

Legacy, a word often associated with public figures, holds a deeper meaning for Iger. He views it through two lenses: his legacy as a father and husband and his professional legacy as the CEO of Disney. Both are intertwined, and he strives to leave behind a company that's admired for its values and integrity, as well as a family that appreciates both his achievements and the love he poured into their lives.

* **Leaving the company in better shape:** Iger's professional legacy is tied to leaving Disney as a globally admired company, known for its quality, integrity, and positive impact.
* **Balancing achievement with love:**  On a personal level, he wants his family to appreciate his accomplishments but prioritize the love and care he showed them.
* **Setting a high bar for future generations:**  He emphasizes the importance of setting a high standard, both professionally and personally, inspiring those who follow.

**"To thine own self be true."** - A Shakespeare quote inscribed in his yearbook by his father, this has become Iger's guiding principle. It speaks to the importance of authenticity, integrity, and self-awareness – crucial qualities for navigating a life in the public eye while remaining true to one's core values.
