## Thriving in Chaos: Lessons from a Global Food Delivery CTO

Building a successful tech career is rarely a straight line. It's about embracing challenges, learning from mistakes, and relentlessly focusing on the customer. In this post, we delve into the fascinating journey of Ben, a seasoned CTO at Delivery Hero, the company behind food delivery giant Foodpanda. From his early days of hacking cheat codes to navigating the complexities of hypergrowth environments, Ben shares valuable insights into leadership, technical debt, and the importance of user experience. 

### Embracing Chaos and User-Centricity

Ben emphasizes the importance of being "at home in chaos" as a CTO. He highlights the unpredictable nature of the role, particularly in a fast-paced industry like food delivery. With user demand spiking overnight, especially during events like the COVID-19 pandemic, Ben had to adapt quickly, manage technical debt, and ensure the reliability of an essential service.  

Here are some key takeaways from his experience: 

* **Customer service is paramount:**  When a new search feature was met with overwhelmingly negative feedback, Ben and his team saw it as a learning opportunity and quickly pivoted. This experience reinforced the importance of prioritizing the customer experience above all else. 
* **Communication is key:**  In hypergrowth environments, it's easy to forget that new team members may not have the same context as those who have been around longer. Ben stresses the need for over-communication to keep everyone aligned and focused on what matters.
* **Quantifying technical debt:**  Engineers often struggle with quantifying the impact of technical debt, making it difficult to prioritize fixes. Ben encourages engineers to determine when technical debt will negatively impact the business and communicate that impact clearly to stakeholders. 

### A Leader's Mindset 

Ben's leadership philosophy is centered around empowering his team and fostering a culture of continuous learning:

* **Lead by example:**  "Your team will never do what you say, but always do what you do." This quote highlights the importance of leading by example and setting the tone for the entire team. 
* **Embrace learning opportunities:**  Ben believes that failures, while sometimes painful, offer invaluable learning experiences. He encourages his team to view setbacks as opportunities to improve and refine their processes. 

### Global Growth and Beyond 

Ben's journey from software engineer to CTO is a testament to the power of perseverance and embracing challenges. His experience at Foodpanda and Delivery Hero underscores the exciting possibilities within the global food delivery industry. 

**"I think one thing is above everything is as a software engineer you need to have an unbelievable laser focus on the experience that you give to your customer because I fundamentally believe in order to have a successful business you first need to provide outstanding experiences to the customer."**

Ben's journey is a powerful reminder that building a successful tech career involves more than technical skills. It's about embracing challenges, prioritizing the customer, and leading with a positive and adaptable mindset.
