## The Gritty Truth Behind Success: A Conversation with Bastian Lehmann

Bastian Lehmann, co-founder of Postmates and now founder of TipTop, is a man who embodies the spirit of Silicon Valley: a restless drive to innovate, an unwavering belief in technology's power, and a refreshingly candid perspective on the tech industry. In a recent conversation, he shared insights from his journey, revealing the grit, determination, and – dare we say – audacious hustling that fueled his success.

### Early Days and the American Dream:

Bastian's entrepreneurial spirit emerged early. Growing up in Germany, his fascination with computers led him down a rabbit hole of exploration. He even managed to get free internet access through what can only be described as a masterclass in social engineering (more on that later!). 

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Early influences shape entrepreneurial drive:**  From playing in the forest to organizing exhibitions with friends, Bastian's childhood was marked by a constant desire to explore and create.
* **The allure of the US:**  Bastian harbored a lifelong fascination with the United States, fueled by the possibilities offered by its tech scene.

### The Power of Determination (and a San Francisco Phonebook):

Bastian's journey to the US was not straightforward. He recounted a story about obtaining free internet access by convincing people in San Francisco to share their calling card details.  With a phonebook from San Francisco gifted by his father and a convincing American accent, he managed to pull off this feat – a testament to his resourcefulness and unwavering determination. 

* **Grit trumps luck:**  Bastian firmly believes that determination and hard work are the true drivers of success.  
* **The importance of mentors:**  A chance encounter with an older "nerd" taught Bastian the tricks of navigating the early internet, leading to his first bulletin board and setting the stage for his future endeavors.

### Postmates: A Love Story Forged in Wartime:

Building Postmates was a "wartime" experience. Facing fierce competition, billion-dollar funding rounds, and constant pressure, the team's resilience was tested repeatedly. Bastian described a deep sense of camaraderie within the company, a shared love for the mission that kept them united amidst the chaos.

**Key Insights:**

* **The importance of team culture:**  Postmates' success was rooted in a shared passion and a sense of unity that allowed them to weather any storm.
* **Strategic fundraising:** Bastian highlights the need to understand the market dynamics and the potential inflection points before diving into massive fundraising rounds.
* **Knowing your fundamentals:**  He emphasizes the importance of having a solid business model and a clear path to profitability, especially in a competitive landscape.

### The Uber Acquisition: A Bittersweet Symphony:

The acquisition by Uber was a major turning point. While the reported price was $2.65 billion, Bastian reveals that the final amount paid out to shareholders was nearly $5 billion, thanks to a favorable exchange ratio. Despite the financial success, he admits to feeling a sense of loss at not being able to celebrate this milestone with his team due to the pandemic.

**Highlights:**

* **Knowing when to consolidate:**  Bastian believes that the market's need to consolidate played a role in the decision to sell to Uber.
* **Negotiating a good deal:** He stresses the importance of strong deal terms, like no break-up fee or collar, which allowed Postmates to benefit from Uber's rising share price.
* **Putting ego aside:** While tempted to go public with Postmates, Bastian chose to prioritize the company's future and the opportunity to be part of something bigger.

### Second Time Around:  Building TipTop with Wisdom and Humility:

Bastian's new venture, TipTop, is fueled by the lessons learned from his Postmates experience. He emphasizes the need for humility, agility, and a focus on building a strong product, rather than getting caught up in external pressures.  

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Learning from mistakes:**  He acknowledges that knowing what not to do is just as important as knowing what to do.
* **Selecting the right VC partners:** Bastian emphasizes building relationships with investors who share your vision and offer genuine support.
* **Managing board meetings effectively:**  He recommends a strategic approach to board meetings, involving pre-meeting dinners and well-prepared presentations to ensure smooth communication and alignment.

### Hot Takes and Predictions:

Bastian doesn't shy away from expressing his opinions, offering some provocative hot takes on the future of technology:

* **Inference computers are the next frontier:**  He predicts a future where personal AI will be powered by dedicated inference computers in every home.
* **The phone is dead:**  While not literally dead, he believes smartphones have peaked in their importance in our lives.
* **Vision Pro is a product in search of a market:**  He sees limited potential for Apple's VR headset beyond niche applications in science, medicine, and media.

### The Value of a Founder CEO:

Bastian strongly believes in the power of founder-led companies. He expresses admiration for CEOs like Patrick Collison of Stripe and Zac Prince of BlockFi, highlighting their resilience, leadership, and dedication to building enduring businesses.

### The Most Important Lesson: 

Beyond all the strategies and predictions, the core message resonating from Bastian's words is this:

> “I just know that most companies fail because the founders give up. And we refused to give up.”

This simple yet powerful statement encapsulates the essence of Bastian's approach to entrepreneurship. It's not about luck, hype, or even VC connections.  It's about the unwavering commitment, the relentless drive to push forward, and the refusal to let go of your dream, even when the world seems stacked against you.
